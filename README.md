# 4Paws: Pet Shelter App for Prediction and Recommendation
Pet Shelter App for Prediction and Recommendation. This project aims to assist pet shelters in predicting the probability of pet adoption and providing recommendations. This tool utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors influencing adoption rates and suggests potential matches between pets and adopters.

## Project Overview
4Paws is a machine learning-based tool designed to assist pet shelters in predicting the probability of pet adoption and providing personalized recommendations. This application helps shelter staff make informed decisions by analyzing various factors influencing adoption rates, and it suggests optimal matches between pets and potential adopters based on data-driven insights.

## Features
- Adoption Probability Prediction: The app predicts the likelihood of a pet being adopted using machine learning algorithms, helping shelters focus on pets needing more attention.

- Pet-Adopter Matching: The app recommends potential matches between available pets and adopters based on survey results about preferences.

- Data-Driven Insights: The app analyzes various factors such as pet age, breed, size, and medical history to influence predictions and recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- Machine Learning: Algorithms such as RandomForest was used to predict adoption probability.

- Python: Core programming language for building the predictive model and backend.

- Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for data processing and analysis.

- Scikit-learn: Used for building machine learning models.

- Streamlit: A framework to host the app.

- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization libraries to help in analyzing data trends.
  
## Usage
Data Input: Upload the dataset of pets available for adoption, including features like breed, age, size, health conditions, etc.

Training the Model: Use the included scripts to train the model on the dataset.

Prediction and Recommendation: The app will output adoption probabilities for each pet and provide recommendations based on the data.
