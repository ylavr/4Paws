        "description": "Are you a cat lover looking for your daily dose of cuteness? Look no further! Let me introduce you to Blanco, a charming 3.5-month-old kitten who is stealing hearts everywhere with his chill demeanor and lovable personality.\n\nOne of Blanco's unique quirks is his love for sitting in sinks. Whether it's the bathroom sink or the kitchen sink, you can often find him perched there, looking utterly content. There's just something about the cool porcelain. It's both adorable and amusing to witness!\n\nDespite his young age, Blanco is incredibly affectionate. He loves cuddling up to his humans, purring contentedly as he receives pets and scratches behind the ears. It's heartwarming to see how much love he has to give, making him the perfect companion for anyone in need of a furry friend.\n\nBlanco has a brother, named Fuego, who is a bundle of energy. While Blanco may be more on the laid-back side, he enjoys watching Fuego play with his toys and explore their surroundings. It's clear that the bond between these two kittens is strong, and it's heartening to see them interact and care for each other.\n\nIf you're looking to add some joy and warmth to your days, Blanco is the perfect kitten for you. His chill personality, love for sinks, and affectionate nature make him a delightful companion who will brighten up your home in an instant.\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue is a Mississippi\u00a0based rescue. All animals are currently in MS. Mississippi is overpopulated with too many animals, not enough adopters, and many high kill shelters. For Pet's Sake Rescue saves each animal from a different background.\u00a0\n\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue transports animals to other states for better adoption potential. Our goal is to keep animals alive and out of kennels into their forever homes as quickly as possible. Each animal is quarantined and vetted during their time in our care. Each adopted pet is spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and has current\u00a0flea treatment unless otherwise noted.\u00a0\n\nYou can visit our website at www.forpetssakerescue.org for our full adoption process and adoption application. Once we review your application and check your vet reference, we will contact you to proceed. If both parties agree to the adoption, we will send you an Adoption Contract with an invoice. Once the invoice is paid, your pet is \"on hold\" for you to pick up or we can transport the pet to a designated location closer to you via transport. Transports are arranged for specific dates. We will discuss these dates and locations with you during the initial phone call.\u00a0\n\nWe are currently unable to adopt pets to ME\u00a0and RI residents.\n\nAny of our adoptable animals can be transported unless otherwise noted in their profile.

They were shy upon arrival, but now are enjoying gentle affection and treats on the regular. Butch is the more quiet of the pair and would greatly benefit from being adopted alongside another similarly-aged kitten to help promote confidence through social interaction!

She is only about 1 year old and was lucky enough to be taken off the streets before having her first litter of kittens. April proved to be a good first-time mom but is now ready to be spoiled and have it be all about her. Barely more than a kitten herself, April is starting to come into her own and is looking for someone to cultivate a relationship with her. She loves attention, play and of course lots of treats. April is ready to find her forever home and bring sparkle to her new family!\n\nApril has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for Feline Leukemia and Feline AIDS.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting one or two or three of us, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet her.\n\nWe require a donation of $100 per cat which will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat(s) received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.\n\n*All kittycorner.org kittens/cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee. If at any time, for any reason they need to be returned/rehomed, please just return them to KittyCorner. We will happily take them back as our mission is to ensure that all our adoptees will always have a safe place to stay and call home.",

She enjoys a little bit of everything, whether it be food, attention, or time alone. Willa and Waldo are used to living together and would do well in a home together, though this is not a rigid requirement. If you would like more information on these kitties, give us a call or stop in to meet them!",

We love to play and wrestle with each other as we have a lot of energy! Unfortunately, our first home did not work out because of how much we like to play and how interactive we are. Our favorite things to do are play and nap with one another. We love playing with string toys, springs, and stuffed mice. We have a lot of energy and would be great in a home with a young couple/person, children, and/or other pets. We have never been around dogs, but we adapt well to any situation so likely would be no problem once we got to know them. We are bonded and want to find our forever home together! We are fixed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, free of fleas and worms, FIV/FELV negative, and super adorable! Come meet us :)\n\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder). \n\nYour donation of $160 per kitten (kittens are microchipped) will contribute to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

She loves to play with her sister and enjoys being up high, watching everything around her with keen interest.\n\nPenelope gets along well with other cats and dogs. Although she\u2019s not the biggest fan of being held, she loves pets and belly rubs, showing her affectionate side in her own unique way. Her curiosity and spunk make her an entertaining and endearing companion.\n\nPenelope would be best suited for a home with someone who can let her be a kitten, allowing her to grow and learn. She would thrive in an environment where she has plenty of room to run and climb, satisfying her adventurous spirit.\n\nPenelope is bonded with her sister, Daphne, so they need to be adopted together. This special bond ensures they will bring double the joy and love to their new home. If you\u2019re looking for a pair of playful and loving kittens, Penelope and Daphne are the perfect match!\n\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results were provided at intake.\n\n** OUR CATS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE. Read below for more information.\n\nOur cats are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. The adoption contract and fee are finalized prior to transport.

She loves to play with her sister and has a special way of falling into you and snuggling into your neck, making every cuddle session delightful.\n\nDaphne gets along well with other cats and dogs. As a kitten, she still nibbles and makes biscuits on everything, adding a touch of kitten charm to her playful antics. She loves exploring her surroundings and playing, embodying the perfect mix of energy and affection.\n\nDaphne would be best suited for a home with someone who can let her be a kitten and support her learning and growth. She would thrive in an environment where she can run, pounce, and indulge in her playful nature. Importantly, Daphne is bonded with her sister, Penelope, so they need to be adopted together to continue their loving companionship.\n\nDaphne's spunky and affectionate nature, combined with her bond with Penelope, makes her an ideal addition to a loving home ready to embrace the joy and energy of two playful kittens. If you're looking for a pair of loving, playful, yet different kittens to add to your family, Daphne and Penelope are the perfect match!\n\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results were provided at intake.\n\n** OUR CATS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE. Read below for more information.\n\nOur cats are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. The adoption contract and fee are finalized prior to transport. As a Pep's Pals Rescue direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).\n\nOur adoption fee is $300 for the bonded pair ($150 each) plus health certificate and transport (varies by location).

Born April 22, 2024 to a sweet tiny cat named Daisy (also posted for adoption), this bunch packs a punch. Malarkey is the character of the bunch and is sure to add some spice to your life! He is an adventurous kitten who loves to explore, chase toys and climb high. This little fur ball is ready to find his forever home where he can bring a lifetime of laughs, come meet him and his brothers today!\n\nMalarkey has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for Feline Leukemia and Feline AIDS.\n\n*All kittens need to be adopted in pairs unless going to a home with another young, playful cat or cats who would be very friendly and accepting of a new kitten. We have many options for pairing, including litter mates, other kittens and young to adult cats. We will happily help you decide on the right combo if you like!\n\nTo express an interest in adopting one or two or three of us, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet him.\n\nWe require a donation of $100 per cat which will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat(s) received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.",

This pair of kittens are outgoing, affectionate, they LOVE to be carried around and held. They are well socialized with other cats and do well with respectful dogs.\n\nKai & Kinder are just over 2 1/2 months old, they are available to adopt for our next transport the weekend of August 17th/18th. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THESE TWO!!!\n\nPLEASE READ THIS TO ADOPT:\n\nWe only adopt kittens in pairs unless there is another young (2 years or younger) cat already in the home for the new kitten to play with. Having a feline friend can be incredibly beneficial for their social and emotional well-being, providing comfort and support throughout their lives.\n\nPlease COPY and PASTE the following URL for the adoption application:\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/FPSL/Cat\n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES. If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application. \n\nPlease note that our animals are rescued and transported from South Mississippi where major animal overpopulation means less homes. We only transport them if adopted, in most instances, we can be available for a video call once an application has been approved.\n\nWe are USDA certified and WE PERSONALLY TRANSPORT OUR adopted animals to meet their new families. We transport every 2-3 weeks.\n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, Microchip, Mississippi Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you\n",

        "description": "Meet Limerick, brother to Maguire, Timothy and Malarkey. This bunch of mackerel striped tabby kittens will RiverDance their way straight into your heart! Born April 22, 2024 to a sweet tiny cat named Daisy (also posted for adoption), this bunch packs a punch. Limerick's special talents include cuddling, purring, and posing for the camera. He is also highly skilled in chasing toys and climbing cat trees. Now Limerick is looking for his forever home where he will be given all the love and attention he deserves! In return he will give you a lifetime of laughter, love, and joy!\n\nLimerick has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for Feline Leukemia and Feline AIDS.\n\n*All kittens need to be adopted in pairs unless going to a home with another young, playful cat or cats who would be very friendly and accepting of a new kitten. We have many options for pairing, including litter mates, other kittens and young to adult cats. We will happily help you decide on the right combo if you like!\n\nTo express an interest in adopting one or two or three of us, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct.

        "description": "Asia- white tabby\nDionne- brown tabby\n\nIn the vast world of feline companionship, there are some special bonds that go beyond the ordinary. Meet Asia and Dionne, a truly inseparable bonded pair of cats whose connection runs deep. These two furry siblings not only depend on each other but also showcase a level of affection and camaraderie that is truly heartwarming.\n\nAsia and Dionne are not your average cats. They are cuddly, shy, and have a special bond that is evident to anyone who sets eyes on them. These two feline companions love nothing more than being by each other's side, whether it's lounging in the sun together or curling up for a cozy nap.\n\nDespite their shy nature with new humans, Asia and Dionne are incredibly affectionate cats. They enjoy being petted and cuddled, and they have a gentle and loving demeanor that makes them a joy to be around. Their quiet presence and sweet personalities make them the perfect companions for anyone looking for a little feline love in their life.\n\nWhile Asia and Dionne may be a bonded pair, they are also great with other cats. They are friendly and sociable, and they have a knack for getting along with their furry counterparts. Their easygoing nature and gentle demeanor make them a welcome addition to any feline family.\n\nWhile Asia and Dionne may be cat-friendly, they are not fans of dogs.\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue is a Mississippi\u00a0based rescue. All animals are currently in MS. These girls can be transported to Albany, NY. Mississippi is overpopulated with too many animals, not enough adopters, and many high kill shelters. For Pet's Sake Rescue saves each animal from a different background.\u00a0\n\n***Breed input is required for each platform but is not guaranteed to be accurate. We do not DNA\u00a0test. We rescue animals from different situations. We discuss breed assignments with our vets to label them as accurately as possible.***\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue transports animals to other states for better adoption potential. Our goal is to keep animals alive and out of kennels into their forever homes as quickly as possible. Each animal is quarantined and vetted during their time in our care. Each adopted pet is spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and has current\u00a0flea treatment unless otherwise noted.\u00a0\n\nYou can visit our website at\u00a0www.forpetssakerescue.org\u00a0for our full adoption process and adoption application. Once we review your application and check your vet reference, we will contact you to proceed. If both parties agree to the adoption, we will send you an Adoption Contract with an invoice. Once the invoice is paid, your pet is \"on hold\" for you to pick up or we can transport the pet to a designated location closer to you via transport. Transports are arranged for specific dates. We will discuss these dates and locations with you during the initial phone call.\u00a0\n\nWe are currently unable to adopt pets to ME and RI residents.\n\nAny of our adoptable animals can be transported unless otherwise noted in their profile.

He will greet you every time you walk in the door! Anthony\u00a0gets along wonderfully with other cats and dogs, making him an ideal companion for a multi-pet household.\n\nAnthony enjoys his\u00a0toys and cherishes his nap times. He's\u00a0fully litter box trained and enjoys being held, showcasing his well-socialized nature. If you're looking for an adorable kitten to share your home and life with, Anthony is the one for you!\n\nHe can be adopted alone or with one of his brothers, Benedict or Collin. His 2 sisters, Daphne and Penelope, are\u00a0bonded. Here\u2019s the link to our adoptable pets (copy & paste it into your browser then filter results to just cats):https://pepspalsrescue.org/available-pets\n\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results were provided at intake.\n\n*** OUR CATS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE. Read below for more information.\n\nOur cats are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. The adoption contract and fee are finalized prior to transport. As a Pep's Pals Rescue direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).\n\nOur adoption fee for Anthony\u00a0is $275 ( $75 of this fee is a mandatory neuter deposit that will be reimbursed when adopter gets him\u00a0neutered at 6 months old as he is cryptorchid & couldn't be neutered sooner) plus health certificate and transport (varies by location). This fee includes all current vaccinations, deworming, microchip (additional $13 lifetime registration fee required at time of adoption),\u00a0and a FIV/FELV test. A health exam will be completed and a health certificate issued by a veterinarian within 10 days of transport.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the adoption application below:\n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/57831/generic",

She was only a kitten herself when she was pregnant and surrendered to the shelter in May 2024.  This petite little girl gave birth to SEVEN kittens and was a fabulous momma to them.  The kittens were extremely rowdy and playful.  They soon grew to about the same size as her as she looked over them.  It is now time for Snow White to have a happy ending and a castle of her own.  She deserves it after her tireless work nurturing her babies who have begun finding homes of their own. \n\nSnow White loves to lounge and be pet.  She has a sweet nature.  \n\nShe been spayed, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nVisit the Dewitt PetSmart if you'd like to meet our sensational Snow White.",

Let BonBon and her heart of gold brighten your day.  She's in a foster placement with cats and dogs, whom she does well with.\n\nShe has been spayed, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nSince she's in a foster placement, please fill out an application if you'd like to meet our beloved BonBon.  Once it is approved, we will set up an appointment.\n\nHere's a link to our application.\nhttps://cnysnap.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CNY_SNAP_PetSMart_Adoption_Application_11-19-2021-1.pdf\n\n",

        "description": "Meet Auggie and Amara! They are looking to be adopted as a pair. Amara is a female longhair gray female who was abandoned by her mother as a newborn and raised as a bottle baby. Auggie is a male gray shorthair with the most adorable white toes on his hind paws. He was taken in around the time that both kittens were about 2 weeks old so that Amara wouldn\u2019t be a single kitten. \n\n\nThankfully, all ended up well and they bonded immediately. Both kittens have very different personalities; however, they complement each other wonderfully.\n\nAmara is more fear-free and quicker to trust. She still takes a bit to settle in but once she does she is the more outgoing of the two. She loves getting affection and is really just as sweet as can be.\n\nAuggie is the more cautious of the two but once he settles in he is playful, goofy and loving. Amara definitely helps him come out of his shell when they are in new environments and adjusting to new people and things.\nAuggie is also super sweet but not quite as cuddly as Amara is. That being said, they both play hard and rest hard and they are people loving kitties who need a home that can provide lots of love.\n\nBecause Auggie can be a bit shy at first, their foster mom thinks that while they would do well and adjust to a multitude of home environments that it would be best if the home wasn\u2019t extremely loud and busy.\nOlder children would be best versus toddlers. Adopters will need some patience to let them settle in. They are used to dog sounds, smells and sights but have not had direct contact with dogs.\nA calm dog without a tendency to chase should be fine so long as they are introduced appropriately.\nThey both should also do well with other cats and even if the other cat(s) weren\u2019t super keen on kitten shenanigans and playing Amara and Auggie do just fine keeping each other busy and happy.\n\nIf interested in adopting Amara and Auggie, the first step is filling out an adoption application at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application. Just make sure that you note the app is for Auggie and Amara on Petfinder. \n\nPlease if possible text their foster mom Laura to let her know when you have submitted an application at 315-415-7572.\n\nOnce an application is received it will be processed and if approved, we will set up a meet and greet +/- potential adoption.\n\n*Both kittens are tested negative for Feline Aids (FIV), Feline Leukemia (FeLV) and heart worm disease. They are up to date on their FVRCP vaccine boosters and dewormed thoroughly along with being on monthly flea prevention. Their spay/neuter and rabies vaccine will be done when they are 4-5 months old and their foster mom will help orchestrate this unless you prefer to use your own vet.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder). \n\nYour donation of $140 each ($160 if the kitten is microchipped) will contribute to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

        "description": "Didi just turned 3 months old, he is an affectionate boy, loves attention and being held. Didi is part of a large kitten play group and should do well with most any family. Didi is a pretty gray tabby with tan on his feet, he is bigger than most of his siblings and he has big feet for his age, he should be a full sized cat as an adult. \n\nDidi's mom is a Siamese/mix so he has the chatty tendencies of a Siamese cat. He loves to talk to you!\n\nPLEASE READ THIS TO ADOPT:\n\nWe only adopt kittens in pairs unless there is another young (2 years or younger) cat already in the home for the new kitten to play with. Having a feline friend can be incredibly beneficial for their social and emotional well-being, providing comfort and support throughout their lives.\n\nThere is a discount when adopting more than one pet.\n\nPlease COPY and PASTE the following URL for the adoption application:\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/FPSL/Cat\n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES. If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application. \n\nPlease note that our animals are rescued and transported from South Mississippi where major animal overpopulation means less homes. We only transport them if adopted, in most instances, we can be available for a video call once an application has been approved.\n\nWe are USDA certified and WE PERSONALLY TRANSPORT OUR adopted animals to meet their new families. We transport every 2-3 weeks.\n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, Microchip, Mississippi Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you\n",

This bonded pair has been absolutely obsessed with each other for every second they've been in our care. They play, wrestle, sleep, snuggle, and eat together. Just wait until they shine those baby blues at you and sing for more treats, it is SO cute. They are the funniest kittens and a true joy on top of being adorable. I feel so lucky to have spent so much time getting to love these boys! They are both fully litter trained, neutered, microchipped, up to date on all vaccines, FIV/ FELV negative, and ready to love. \n\n\n3 months old.  $160/ea.

His beautiful mother April (also posted for adoption) was a young pregnant stray who was desperately looking for a place to have her kittens. Luckily, she ran into the right person at the right time! Now Liam and his brothers Rowan and Killian, born on April 18, 2024, are ready for adoption! All three brothers have the most whirly swirly classic tabby coats and the most brilliant green eyes. Liam is what you would call the baby brother: he is the cautious one - at least he considers the consequences before getting into trouble! He looks pretty much identical to Killian, except Liam has what you call a \"taillight,\" which is a white tip on his tail. He is a sweet and playful kitten who loves to chase toys and snuggle up in cozy spots. Consider adopting the pair for double the fun!\n\nLiam has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for Feline Leukemia and Feline AIDS.\n\n*All kittens need to be adopted in pairs unless going to a home with another cat or cats who would be very friendly and accepting of a new kitten. We have many options for pairing including litter mates, other kittens and young to adult cats. We will happily help you decide on the right combo if you like!\n\nTo express an interest in adopting one or two or three of us, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet him.\n\nWe require a donation of $100 per cat, which will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat(s) received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.",

She is the mother of Timothy, Maguire, Malarkey and Limerick (also posted for adoption)! All the kittens look just like their mom, with their pretty mackerel tabby stripes and the same lovely yellow-green eyes. For being pretty much a kitten herself, Daisy has proved to be nurturing and gentle, and she's now ready to find a forever home where she can receive all the love and attention she deserves. If I had to describe Daisy in one word it would be \"cutie pie\". She is a friendly little kitty who loves to play with her favorite toys, and is very eager to please. But she is also a total couch potato and will have no problem curling up next to you or sitting in your lap. Consider adopting Daisy with one of her kittens for double the cuteness!\n\nDaisy is approximatly10 months old, has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for Feline Leukemia and Feline AIDS.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting her, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/.

        "description": "Are you looking for a new feline companion to brighten up your home? Look no further than Apricot, a rare 14-week-old female orange tabby with a unique personality that is sure to steal your heart. Apricot is not your average orange tabby. With her striking coat and rare gender for the coloration, she is truly a gem among felines.\u00a0\n\nOne thing you'll notice about Apricot right away is her playful and vocal nature. She loves to chase after toys, climb to new heights, and engage in interactive play with her human companions. Her meows are sweet and melodic, making her a joy to be around.\n\nDespite her initial shyness, Apricot is great with dogs, cats, and children. She is a social butterfly once she warms up to you and will quickly become the center of attention in any room. Her friendly demeanor makes her a perfect fit for households with multiple pets or young children.\n\nApricot is always on the lookout for new adventures. Whether it's exploring a new room in the house or investigating a mysterious noise, she approaches everything with curiosity and excitement. You'll love watching her boundless energy and zest for life.\n\nIf you're interested in adding Apricot to your family, be prepared for a playful and loving companion who will bring endless joy into your life. With her unique looks, friendly personality, and adventurous spirit, Apricot is sure to make a lasting impression on everyone she meets.\n\n\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue is a Mississippi\u00a0based rescue. All animals are currently in MS. Apricot can be transported to Albany, NY. Mississippi is overpopulated with too many animals, not enough adopters, and many high kill shelters. For Pet's Sake Rescue saves each animal from a different background.\u00a0\n\n***Breed input is required for each platform but is not guaranteed to be accurate. We do not DNA\u00a0test. We rescue animals from different situations. We discuss breed assignments with our vets to label them as accurately as possible.***\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue transports animals to other states for better adoption potential. Our goal is to keep animals alive and out of kennels into their forever homes as quickly as possible. Each animal is quarantined and vetted during their time in our care. Each adopted pet is spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and has current\u00a0flea treatment unless otherwise noted.\u00a0\n\nYou can visit our website at\u00a0www.forpetssakerescue.org\u00a0for our full adoption process and adoption application. Once we review your application and check your vet reference, we will contact you to proceed. If both parties agree to the adoption, we will send you an Adoption Contract with an invoice. Once the invoice is paid, your pet is \"on hold\" for you to pick up or we can transport the pet to a designated location closer to you via transport. Transports are arranged for specific dates. We will discuss these dates and locations with you during the initial phone call.\u00a0\n\nWe are currently unable to adopt pets to ME and RI residents.\n\nAny of our adoptable animals can be transported unless otherwise noted in their profile. View all of our adopted animals at www.forpetssakerescue.org",

She doesn't love small children quite so much (although she is kind to them, loud noises make her a little skittish) but is very very happy with other cats and with grown ups. Waffle loves to play and chase, she loves to carry around toys and share them with her siblings. She is always trying to snuggle the grown ups and would be a wonderful companion to a household with other pets or someone willing to adopt two kittens.\n\n\n\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee of $160 contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, microchipping, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099\n\n",

She loves head pets and when you stop petting her, she will let you know she wants more because she will take her paw to gently tap you to let you know you\u2019re not done petting her ? She is a loving girl who will follow you around the house, sleep in the bed with you, and lay beside you while you\u2019re lounging around watching TV. If you\u2019re looking for a companion who is loyal, affectionate, and appreciative of \u201cliving her best life\u201d, this is your girl.",

Soft, stunning and affectionate, she uses her polydactyl mittens to grab your hand so she can give kisses. She will also talk to you loudly when she wants her meals. \n\nSasha is curious, affectionate and very playful. Her favorite toys so far are her racetrack glitter ball and her rainbow ribbon wand. \n\nThough Sasha gets on well with other cats, we think Sasha would like to the leader of her cat group and therefore would do best in a home with submissive male cats or non-dominant female cats. \n\nSasha is negative for FIV and FeLV and will need to remain an indoor only cat. \n\nShe is ready to take over your heart and your home. Apply today and adopt a legend!\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder). \n\nYour donation of $100 ($120 if the cat is microchipped) will contribute to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

        "description": "Baba is the best air biscuit maker! He is always purring and kneeding dough. He would have been a great pizza maker because he even kneeds in the air. He is a very affectionate cat. \n\nBaba came from a colony in Leakesville, MS. He was much too friendly to be left to fend for himself without the love of his own family. He is very deserving of a safe loving home. \n\nGreat with other cats. \n\nDogs unknown. \n\n \n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue is a Mississippi based rescue. All animals are currently in MS. Mississippi is overpopulated with too many animals, not enough adopters, and many high kill shelters. For Pet's Sake Rescue saves each animal from a different background. \n\n***Breed input is required for each platform but is not guaranteed to be accurate. We do not DNA test. We rescue animals from different situations.We discuss breed assignments with our vets to label them as accurately as possible.***\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue transports animals to other states for better adoption potential. Our goal is to keep animals alive and out of kennels into their forever homes as quickly as possible. Each animal is quarantined and vetted during their time in our care. Each adopted pet is spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and has current flea treatment unless otherwise noted. \n\nYou can visit our website at www.forpetssakerescue.org for our full adoption process and adoption application. Once we review your application and check your vet reference, we will contact you to proceed. If both parties agree to the adoption, we will send you an Adoption Contract with an invoice. Once the invoice is paid, your pet is \"on hold\" for you to pick up or we can transport the pet to a designated location closer to you via transport. Transports are arranged for specific dates. We will discuss these dates and locations with you during the initial phone call. \n\nWe are currently unable to adopt pets to ME and RI residents.\n\nAny of our adoptable animals can be transported unless otherwise noted in their profile. View all of our adopted animals at www.forpetssakerescue.org",

She is an adorable blend of independence and affection, embodying the best qualities of a feline companion.\n\nWhile Kathy enjoys her own space and is content to explore and play on her own, she also loves to cuddle. Her soft meow and soothing purr are sure to melt your heart. Kathy is playful and curious, with a particular fondness for wand toys, scratchers, and sunny windows offering a view of the world outside.\n\nKathy has a gentle nature that extends to children as well. She was gentle and friendly with an 8-year-old child who visited her, demonstrating her adaptability and sociability.\n\nRescued as a pregnant stray, Kathy has shown her nurturing side by lovingly caring for her kittens, who have since found their own homes. Now, it's Kathy's turn to find a loving home where she can enjoy the carefree life she deserves.\n\nIf you have a warm heart and a cozy lap, Kathy could be the perfect addition to your family.

        "description": "Jeep is a charming young male cat who is currently looking for a loving home. He is proudly presented for adoption by the CNY Cat Coalition.\n\nJeep is a domestic short-haired feline with a striking black and white coat. At approximately 12-14 months old, he\u2019s just stepping into his prime. His youthful energy is balanced by a laid-back demeanor that makes him a joy to be around.\n\nOne of Jeep\u2019s most endearing qualities is his sweet nature. He\u2019s a gentle soul who quickly warms up to new people. Once he\u2019s comfortable with you, which usually doesn\u2019t take long, he\u2019s not shy about expressing himself. In fact, Jeep can be quite vocal, often engaging in adorable \u201cconversations\u201d with his human friends.\n\nJeep is also great with other cats, making him an excellent addition to a multi-cat household. However, his easy-going personality means he\u2019d be equally happy as an only pet.\n\nIn short, Jeep is a delightful cat who is ready to bring joy and companionship to his forever home. If you\u2019re looking for a sweet, sociable, and slightly chatty feline friend, Jeep could be the perfect match for you.\n\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder). \n\nYour donation of $100 ($120 if the cat is microchipped) will contribute to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

After spending the first few months of his life living on the streets he realized just how much he loves people and wants to be a full time inside cat. He LOVES other cats, especially if they love to wrestle and play chase, and would be great in a house with high energy kids! He is also incredibly curious and loves to explore new spaces and find new climbing spots, and will run up and purr at anyone he meets. Okra would need another young cat or kitten in the house with him to have as a playmate. \n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee of $160 contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, microchipping, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

She is a sweet baby who loves to be snuggled, she can't get enough love! \n\nShe gets overwhelmed with emotions and gives love bites after a while of petting, so I'm learning her cues, and when her tail starts to flick about, she's done with pets until she chills a bit. I could tell as soon as she was rescued that she gets her emotions confused sometimes...like sometimes  she will be bumping your hand for attention while letting out a slight growl, but she definitely means to meow. \n\nPoor girl just needs time to learn. I don't think she was treated the best in her previous living situation so she is definitely still learning how to properly respond to people. She's never reacted in any way that concerns me, and she has been gentle with the kittens in the room too. She just needs a home where someone will love her and treat her with kindness and patience.\n\nJubilee has been spayed, fully vaccinated, dewormed, flea treated, tested negative for felv/fiv, and she is microchipped.",

Now that my kittens are older and weaned, I am looking for my forever home! I am a young 2-year-old cat who loves people. My favorite moments are when I'm being cuddled and petted. My favorite treat is cat nip and I would love a scratching post to stretch on! I have not been around dogs, or children however I am very gentle and likely would do fine in homes with them. I am good with other kitties and have been around my foster mom's own 3 kitties without issue. String toys, love, a comfy spot next to my human(s) and a window are some of the things I would like in my future home. I would love to meet you and be your new companion!\n\nYou can meet Matcha at the Fairmount PetSmart where she is up for adoption!\n\n**Microchipped**\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application say you saw her on petfinder. \n\nYour adoption fee of $120 contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, microchip, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

She loves getting attention from people but can be a little hissy if other cats get too close.  Please remember that the shelter has several cats so it's a big adjustment for one that once had a home.  With patience, Annabelle is sure to blossom into a loving companion but probably needs a calm environment. If you're looking for a feline friend with a little bit of sass and a whole lot of heart, Annabelle might just be the one for you!\n\nShe has been spayed, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.\n\nEmail us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet our spirited Annabelle.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.",

She was brought in as a stray in June 2024.  Despite her timid nature, Opal longs for affection, particularly in the form of head scratches.  She patiently waits for someone to notice her to give her the love and attention she craves. Her quiet demeanor and gentle spirit make her a perfect match for a patient and nurturing owner who can provide her with a calm, peaceful home where she can truly shine.  This girl deserves a home after surviving the streets for who knows how long.\n\nShe has been spayed, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.\n\nEmail us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet our lovely lady Opal.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.\n\n\n\n",

He still looks and acts like any other cat. FIV is only transmitted to other felines primarily through deep, penetrating bite wounds. His adoption fee has been waived because we just want him to find a good home.\n\nHe has been neutered, FeLV negative, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.

        "description": "Do you have room in your heart for this \"odd couple\"? They are a bonded pair looking for a home together!\n\nJake is a solid tank of a cat, probably 7-10 years old, who is extremely outgoing and social with everyone. He loves petting and treats and will meow at you until he gets attention. He's even ok with being help upside down like a baby. He needs to lose the weight he gained in foster care!\n\nMarmalade is 1-2 years old and very playful and active. She is shy compared to Jake but loves petting and she will head butt you even after just meeting you. She loves to chase toys and wrestle with Jake.\n\nBoth cats were living as strays in Fulton and were rescued by a kind business owner who saw them in the parking lot. Marmalade was very sick and almost died from an infection in her uterus called pyometra. Thankfully she was able to get an emergency spay to save her life. Jake had many painful missing and broken teeth and recently had dental surgery to fix all of his teeth. He now has no front teeth at all and is doing great!\n\nThese two kitties love each other dearly and are always wrestling, grooming each other, and burbling. Marmalade absolutely adores Jake and he likes to be her protector (and steal her food). They both get along well with other cats.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw her on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee of $120 each contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, microchips, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

Tris is a very shy lady who generally doesn't ask for attention. She definitely appreciates a good pet when it is given to her though. Since entering the program Tris tested positive for FIV, Although this does affect her immune system, she is perfectly okay to house with other healthy cats. Contact SHHS today if you have space in your lap for this senior sweetie pie.",

Pip is at an early enough age that if someone were willing to take baby steps with her she would make a great companion. If you move nice and slow, she really does appreciate a good chin scratch.

        "description": "Meet Sassy, the 2-year-old Siamese cat who is the epitome of sassiness and laziness. She has a personality as bold as her striking blue eyes.\u00a0\n\nSassy is not your typical cat who enjoys the company of other animals. She has made it clear that she prefers to be the sole focus of attention in her domain. Cats and dogs beware - Sassy does not take kindly to sharing her human. She has a regal air about her, expecting to be treated like the queen she believes she is.\n\nSassy's daily routine consists of lounging in the sun, napping in her favorite spot, and meowing for treats on demand. She has perfected the art of relaxation and takes her role as a professional napper very seriously. Despite her lazy demeanor, Sassy always manages to find a way to make her presence known - whether it's knocking over a plant or climbing to the highest perch in the room.\n\nSassy craves attention like a moth to a flame. She thrives on being the center of everyone's world and will go to great lengths to ensure she gets the love and admiration she deserves.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue is a Mississippi\u00a0based rescue. All animals are currently in MS. Mississippi is overpopulated with too many animals, not enough adopters, and many high kill shelters. For Pet's Sake Rescue saves each animal from a different background.\u00a0\n\n***Breed input is required for each platform but is not guaranteed to be accurate. We do not DNA\u00a0test. We rescue animals from different situations.We discuss breed assignments with our vets to label them as accurately as possible.***\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue transports animals to other states for better adoption potential. Our goal is to keep animals alive and out of kennels into their forever homes as quickly as possible. Each animal is quarantined and vetted during their time in our care. Each adopted pet is spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and has current\u00a0flea treatment unless otherwise noted.\u00a0\n\nYou can visit our website at www.forpetssakerescue.org for our full adoption process and adoption application. Once we review your application and check your vet reference, we will contact you to proceed. If both parties agree to the adoption, we will send you an Adoption Contract with an invoice. Once the invoice is paid, your pet is \"on hold\" for you to pick up or we can transport the pet to a designated location closer to you via transport. Transports are arranged for specific dates. We will discuss these dates and locations with you during the initial phone call.\u00a0\n\nWe are currently unable to adopt pets to ME\u00a0and RI residents.\n\nAny of our adoptable animals can be transported unless otherwise noted in their profile. View all of our adopted animals at www.forpetssakerescue.org\n\nSassy can be transported to Albany, NY",

She is a gorgeous baby black panther who likes to chase string toys and get her head scratched.\n\nShe is a princess who likes things done her way and she would prefer a home without small children.\n\nShe is very independent and doesn't seem interested in other cats so she would be fine as an only kitty or may be fine with another independent cat.\n\nShe was rescued from Upstate hospital after maintenance workers found her trapped in a basement window well she had fallen into.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee of $160 contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, microchip, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099 ",

        "description": "** YOU CAN MEET MATILDA NOW AT PETSMART CAMILLUS!! **\n\nMatilda is a slim, petite, beautiful brown & black tabby cat with white spots & the cutest deep pink dot on her nose! Her foster thinks she must have Siamese in her since she has lots of ticked fur, big eyes & has s deep meow - plus she loves to chat! Matilda is very gentle - one of the sweetest things her foster loves about her (and knows YOU will too!) is she can be picked up and held like a baby on her back in your arms so you can rub her chin while she purrs :-)\n\nMatilda and her four kittens came into foster care a couple months ago, when her babies were just 3 weeks old. Matilda, who's about 1 yr old, was a loving & patient mother and was recently spayed. Matilda gets along well with other cats but is independent enough to be an only cat. (she had to be once she was left to fend for herself by her former owner/s).  Her CNYCC foster doesn't have dogs, but Matilda is spunky & confident and likely can learn to live with a *cat-friendly* dog.\n\nYou can meet Matilda now at the CNYCC adoption center inside PetSmart Camillus. To inquire about Matilda or receive an e-application, please contact her CNYCC foster at CNYadoptCats@gmail.com. Applications can also be submitted online here: https://www.cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application/\n\nYour donation of $120 will contribute to the cost of Matilda's veterinary treatments such as spaying, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, microchipping, deworming, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099 ",

As soon as she was able to, she instantly made kitty friends at my house and there was zero hissing or adjustment period for her. She's equally snuggly and playful!\n\nPetunia has been spayed, fully vaccinated, tested negative for FIV/FELV, dewormed, flea treated, and she is microchipped. ",

They tried their best to keep me, but it was too much.  I do well with cats, kids and dogs! \n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation.\n\nPlease bring with you a cat carrier to safely transport your new cat. If you do not have one, we sell them 10-25. Please note we are cash only.\n\nAdoption donations are 180. We will pay for the microchip's registration for life. All cats have had Distemper, Rabies, tested for FeLV/FIV, dewormed twice and flea treated. It is not uncommon for cats to need to be dewormed more than once, so we do recommend a recheck at your vet. \n\n*Please come to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to meet us!\n\n*Please apply here: http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2\n\n*Please email to set up an appointment DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or (315) 728-9344 or www.DGIPaws.org or www.DogGoneInn.com",

        "description": "Meet Patrick Henry, an extremely playful and energetic 11-month-old kitten. When he was young, Patrick developed a feline herpes viral infection, which in cats gives them red, runny eyes and occasional nasal discharge. This is in no way related to human herpes and is not transmissible to humans. Actually, 90-95% of the feline population tests positive for feline herpes virus, but more than 50% show no symptoms. In fact, none of Patrick's littermates developed any symptoms, including his sister and companion, Abigail Adams, with whom he would like to be adopted.\n\nAt times of stress, Patrick may need to have his eyes treated with over-the-counter Artificial Tears; or if his nose gets stuffy, he might occasionally need to be put on a course of antibiotics, but even though Patrick was dealt this unlucky hand, he doesn't let it affect him in the slightest. No matter what is going on, I can assure you Patrick will be first on the scene to assess the situation. He is a very curious, cute kitten who will steal your heart as soon as you meet him. Do you have the desire to take this special kitten and his lovely, energetic sister, Abby, in open arms?\n\nPatrick has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for FeLV and FIV.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting him, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible, at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet him.\n\nYour donation of $100 per cat will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat(s) received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.\n\n*All kittycorner.org kittens/cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee. If at any time, for any reason they need to be returned/rehomed, please just return them to KittyCorner. We will happily take them back as our mission is to ensure that all our adoptees will always have a safe place to stay and call home.",

        "description": "Ideal emotional support cat for an introvert or someone with anxiety! Smokey is a sweet, friendly 2 year old neutered male cat. He is an American Shorthair, who gets along well with other nice cats (gets scared of territorial cats), and is also ok with nice dogs. He likes older kids if they are calm and gentle, but should not be around tiny tots as he could swat if scared or startled.\n\nSmokey is quite vocal and loves telling you all about his opinions. He wants to be around people all the time, and will follow you around and sleep on your bed if allowed. If left alone away from people, he cries from loneliness, so an owner who does not travel a lot is preferred. Smokey can be shy with strangers at first, so please give him a chance to get used to his new environment.\n\nSmokey is an indoor only cat that uses the litterbox and is fully vaccinated and de-wormed. He is quite allergic to fleas, so he should not be allowed outside and should have monthly flea treatments with Advantage 2, if you have other pets that go outside. Smokey also has sensitive skin, so a household that uses an air purifier is preferred.\nText Smokey's Foster Parent at 315-395-9262 if interested in adopting him.

        "description": "If you are looking for a companion for your existing feline friend, Kristoff is the perfect match. His shy nature makes him a great companion for cats who may be more outgoing and in need of a gentle friend to keep them company. Kristoff's calming presence can help your other cat feel at ease and create a harmonious environment in your home.\n\nWhile shy cats like Kristoff may require a bit more patience and understanding, the rewards of adopting them are immeasurable. Shy cats often form deep bonds with their owners and show immense gratitude for the love and care they receive. By giving a shy cat like Kristoff a chance, you are not only providing a loving home for a deserving animal but also opening your heart to a unique and special bond that will last a lifetime.\n\n He enjoys the simple pleasures in life, such as treats and cozy naps in the sun. He is gentle, but timid. He had a lot of changes early in life and he would appreciate a family that would let him ease into the new norm. Kristoff came to our rescue as a small kitten. His littermates were with their mom in a colony left to fend for themselves. \n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue is a Mississippi based rescue. All animals are currently in MS. \n\n***Breed input is required for each platform but is not guaranteed to be accurate. We do not DNA test. We rescue animals from different situations.We discuss breed assignments with our vets to label them as accurately as possible.***\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue transports animals to other states for better adoption potential. Our goal is to keep animals alive and out of kennels into their forever homes as quickly as possible. Each animal is quarantined and vetted during their time in our care. Each adopted pet is spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and has current flea treatment unless otherwise noted. \n\nYou can visit our website at www.forpetssakerescue.org for our full adoption process and adoption application. Once we review your application and check your vet reference, we will contact you to proceed. If both parties agree to the adoption, we will send you an Adoption Contract with an invoice. Once the invoice is paid, your pet is \"on hold\" for you to pick up or we can transport the pet to a designated location closer to you via transport. Transports are arranged for specific dates. We will discuss these dates and locations with you during the initial phone call. \n\nWe are currently unable to adopt pets to ME and RI residents.\n\nAny of our adoptable animals can be transported unless otherwise noted in their profile. View all of our adopted animals at www.forpetssakerescue.com",

A kind soul rescued him. She isn\u2019t able to keep him but has visited him at the shelter regularly since bringing him in during April 2024. She pets him and brings special treats.\n\nLincoln is terrified in the busy shelter. He needs a quiet home with a patient person that will let him adjust at his own pace. If you are an animal lover and want to help one that is really in need, think of Lincoln.\n\nHe is FIV positive. He still looks and acts like any other cat. FIV is only transmitted to other felines primarily through deep, penetrating bite wounds. His adoption fee has been waived because we just want him to find a good home.\n\nHe has been neutered, FeLV negative, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  Email us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet our shy Lincoln.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.\n",

        "description": "Meet Mr. Whipple, our most eligible bachelor!  He\u2019s a large and friendly cat that is approximately 9 years old. His friendly demeanor makes him the perfect welcoming committee. When guests arrive at the shelter, he often greets them at the door.  He came to the shelter in April after his owner passed.  The busy shelter can be overwhelming for him at times and he would do best in a calm environment.  He was the only cat in a home for a long time.  His charm has won over the volunteers and we are rooting for him to find a loving home.  \n\nUpdate July 2024- he is struggling at the shelter and seems very sad.  Having many other cats around gets him upset.

Sadly, most of her siblings died as they were crossing the road. It took many, many months for her to trust anyone. Now she\u2019s now very playful, sweet, does very well with other cats and loves attention. She prefers munching down her dry Purina cat chow, over canned cat food. Most days she enjoys watching the chipmunk chase the birds away from the feeder in her foster mom\u2019s home office.\n\n \n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee of $100 , $120 if microchipped, contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099\n",

She likes to be held, loves pets and neck-scratches. Belle requires regular grooming, including eye cleaning every couple of days for normal Persian cat eye discharge. Belle needs a dental cleaning by a veterinarian (dental issues are typical for Persians). After that she will require regular veterinary care to monitor her teeth as well as her general health. \nBelle would do well with someone with experience with Persians.",

At this point she\u2019s been with her foster mom for 6+ months. She\u2019s become a sweet, bossy girl who rules the home office. She\u2019s also very vocal at breakfast time, watches the birds out the window and periodically chirps back to get their attention. Tallie gets very anxious with strangers. She should go to a home with older children or non at all. She\u2019s a very fickle girl.\n\n \n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee of $100 , $120 if microchipped, contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099\n\n",

Now I know what some of you might be thinking, just another basic black cat, but that is only because you haven't met me yet! If I could describe myself in one word it would be anything but basic! None of the volunteers can even believe I was a stray before I came here. It must be because I make them laugh and smile all the time. They love the little noises I make to get their attention and they like it even more when I tap them with my paw to ask for pets. Not to mention I follow them around and help them with the chores, I am really not sure how they did it before without me. Now on to my laid-back attitude and friendliness, well that seems to help me fit in pretty much anywhere. Need I say anymore? Come meet me and see for yourself!\n\nCole has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for Feline Leukemia and Feline AIDS.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting him, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet him.\n\nYour donation of $100 per cat will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat(s) received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.\n\n*All kittycorner.org kittens/cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee. If at any time, for any reason they need to be returned/rehomed, please just return them to KittyCorner. We will happily take them back as our mission is to ensure that all our adoptees will always have a safe place to stay and call home.",

She is a beautiful torbie girl with a brown tabby base with orange on top of head and in tail. Wanda is learning to love being petted but is still very scared.\n\nIf you want the satisfaction of helping a cat blossom, Wanda needs you.\n\nThanks to a grant from the Petfinder Foundation, this cat's adoption fee is reduced to just $50\u2014half-off our regular adult cat adoption fee! $20 will be added to this fee for cats who are microchipped.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw him on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "Meet Canyon, a striking young cat with a unique coat and a heart of gold. While he may be on the shy side, Canyon's gentle nature makes him a beloved companion once he feels comfortable. He thrives in the presence of confident feline friends, so a home with another outgoing cat would be ideal to for hime to truly blossom (or a friend from here!). With his sleek black coat adorned with delicate flecks of white, Canyon is not only visually stunning but also a wonderful addition to any family seeking a loyal and affectionate companion. If you're ready to provide a patient and nuturing environment for this shy yet endearing feline, Conyon is ready to share his love and companionship with you.",

He was loved and now finds himself looking for another person(s) to love him.  The family of his owner described him as \"really great with kids, a sweet cat that sits on laps and LOVES catnip.\"  He likes to be pet but no belly rubs.  He's a little shy with new people but adjusts quickly and then you can hear his \"huge purr\".  He was an indoor cat and never around dogs.  While he tolerates other cats, he prefers to be the star of the show.    \n\nOne of the volunteers likes to carry him around and have him sit with her while she does paperwork.  So if you're looking for someone to spoil, come meet Hans.\n\nHe has been neutered, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nEmail us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet our handsome boy Hans.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.",

She was shy when she left and having gone through a return, we\u2019ve had to start all over to help her feel safe and comfortable again. She\u2019s gone from look at me only to I love pets as long as I\u2019m on my safe space.  She gets along with all the other kitties and has started a relationship with one of our older males in her room.  They have eyes only for each other.\nIf you would like to make an appointment to meet Sage you can contact us at 315-985-3738 or send an email to haloadopt@gmail.com.",

He was out on the streets and everyone was feeding him but no one wanted to give him a home to sleep in. The mailman made a pickup and delivered him to our shelter. . He gets along with all the other kitties at the shelter and would be a great companion. He has been neutered and is up to date on shots. If you would like to meet him please text or call Michelle 315-373-3077 or Lisa 315-727-2615 to schedule an appointment",

        "description": "Lizzie, a beautiful gray colored female, is approximately a year and an half old.  She entered the shelter in March 2024. She\u2019s sweet and spicy. She LOVES people and being pet, but prefers to get all the attention for herself.  She gets a little nervous if other cats get close and may hiss.  Her favorite activity has been riding around on top of the food cart at the shelter overseeing the volunteers working.  Being a single cat in a home may be her ideal situation. She could be a diva and all focus would be on her. Hmm, doesn't sound bad!\n\nShe has been spayed, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.\n\nBeing in the busy Dewitt PetSmart store seemed to be stressful for her.  She likes calm environments so she is spending time at a foster home near the Dewitt PetSmart.  If you'd like to meet our spicy little Lizzie, please fill out an application.  Once approved, we will set up a meet and greet. \n\nPlease see the link below for our adoption application.\n\nhttps://cnysnap.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CNY_SNAP_PetSMart_Adoption_Application_11-19-2021-1.pdf\n",

At one point Sammie must have had an accident because her tail had been broken, but healed, and also her leg. She is fine now, just has a barely noticeable limp.  Even with all she went through she still loves people, getting pets, and to snuggle on your lap.  Sammie would be best as an only kitty, and maybe an only pet all around.  She does currently take a happy pill every morning which helps her get along with all the other kitties at HALO.  She really does deserve a home after her ordeal on the streets.  If you would like to give her one you can call us at 315-985-3738 to make an appointment or email us at haloadopt@gmail.con.",

        "description": "This big fellow is Capone and he's approximately 5 years old. He's had a rough life as a stray on the street.  We don't know how long he had been fending for himself but it seemed that life was challenging for him.  He was terrified when he first came to the shelter but has been brave and is much more confident walking around.  He is comfortable with people petting him and will even stretch out, seeming to enjoy the attention.  He seems to enjoy food and it\u2019s hard to get his attention when he\u2019s eating.  Capone needs to know what it's like to be in a loving home.  Please take a chance on Capone.  \n\nHe has been neutered, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nEmail us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet Capone.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.",

She loves being petted and will follow you around. She is playful and enjoys her toys. \nBubbles requires regular grooming - and she is not a big fan, she gets very feisty. She needs occasional baths. Bubbles may require occasional sedated grooming at a vet (she has had a lion cut in the past and did will with it). She needs twice daily eye cleaning for normal Persian cat eye discharge. She will require regular veterinary care to monitor her teeth (Persians are prone to dental issues) as well as her general health. \nBubbles would do well with someone with experience with Persians.",

Unfortunately, life hasn't been so easy for him but we are hoping he can find the right home so he can live out his days as a much happier, thankful Tigger.  \n\nTigger's tragic story... he had already been neutered so he must have had a home at some point but was left out on the streets as a young cat, where he has been living for at least a year.  Someone was feeding him and trying to keep him alive but then had an injury that needed antibiotics.  Someone rescued him, got him treatment and a check up.  He was terrified and overwhelmed but has been getting more comfortable with the person that saved him.  They stated, \"he's gotten real sweet.\"  Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t keep him so he had to go to the shelter.  Given that he is still shy from his experiences, a quiet home without children and other animals would be best to help him feel safe.  \n\nHe is FIV positive.  He still looks and acts like any other cat. FIV is only transmitted to other felines primarily through deep, penetrating bite wounds.   His adoption fee has been waived because we just want him to find a good home.\n\nHe has been neutered, FeLV negative, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nEmail us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet Tigger.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.\n",

        "description": "Julia gave birth and weaned 5 kittens. She was such a wonderful mom and is so sweet and personable! Shortly after she weaned the kittens, she lost her appetite and became lethargic. It turns out she had an intestinal issue, and had to have surgery. She is completely healed and doing amazing!\n\nJulia definitely doesn't like other animals and needs to be in a household with no other cats. We tried her with one other cat, and it unfortunately did not work out. I would also say she shouldn't be placed with babies or young children, or elderly people, because she has SO much energy!\n\nThat being said, Julia is a comedy act all by herself! She loves to jump in boxes, cabinets, drawers, and even refrigerators! She loves jumping on top of window sills, and the higher she jumps, the better she likes it! She is also super skilled at jumping to catch feather toys! She is HIGH energy, but also super sweet when she gets all of the energy out of her system!\n\nJulia is being adopted out through the CNYCC, so please fill out their application. \n\nhttps://www.cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application/\n\nYou can also contact Amy at Voice4TheVoicelessAdoptions and/or (315-753-9227 for more information on Julia and how to adopt her.",

        "description": "Meet Merlin and Galahad, four-year-old \"Bros\"! These two bring new meaning to brotherly love so we would really love for them to go together! We ended up with these two after their owner was unfortunately no longer able to care for them. Thankfully, they had each other and are thriving under the circumstances. You really get the best of both worlds with these two! Merlin, the long-haired Wizard, has the beauty and Galahad, the short-haired Knight, has the brawn. Not to mention both have the most dazzling eyes and silky coats. While these two are adorably affectionate with each other they are equally affectionate with all of our volunteers! These large boys love attention, getting pets and of course getting into trouble together! With these two having such a tight bond they need to be the only cats in the household. Do you have it in your heart to give these two the forever home they deserve?\n\nBoth boys have been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and have tested negative for FELV/FIV.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting this pair, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible, at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nYour donation of $100 per cat will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat(s) received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.\n\n*All kittycorner.org kittens/cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee. If at any time, for any reason they need to be returned/rehomed, please just return them to KittyCorner. We will happily take them back as our mission is to ensure that all of our adoptees will always have a safe place to stay and call home.",

        "description": "Meet Merlin and Galahad, four-year-old \"Bros\"! These two bring new meaning to brotherly love so we would really love for them to go together! We ended up with these two after their owner was unfortunately no longer able to care for them. Thankfully, they had each other and are thriving under the circumstances. You really get the best of both worlds with these two! Merlin, the long-haired Wizard, has the beauty and Galahad, the short-haired Knight, has the brawn. Not to mention both have the most dazzling eyes and silky coats. While these two are adorably affectionate with each other they are equally affectionate with all of our volunteers! These large boys love attention, getting pets and of course getting into trouble together! With these two having such a tight bond they need to be the only cats in the household. Do you have it in your heart to give these two the forever home they deserve?\n\nBoth boys have been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and have tested negative for FELV/FIV.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting this pair, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible, at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nYour donation of $100 per cat will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat(s) received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.\n\n*All kittycorner.org kittens/cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee. If at any time, for any reason they need to be returned/rehomed, please just return them to KittyCorner. We will happily take them back as our mission is to ensure that all of our adoptees will always have a safe place to stay and call home.",

        "description": " Newt is just about 1 year old and is rather shy but has come a long way with learning to love people. He was extremely shy and nervous around people for a long time but now is seeking out human contact and petting, though he can still be nervous and scared of noises and sudden movements. He does like to be next to his foster mom. Newt likes wand toys and dangling toys with feathers and will happily play with them.\n\nHe needs a home with older kids and someone experienced with cats and willing to work with him.\n\nNewt has been around dogs and cats and does well.\n\nHe is microchipped.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder).\n\nYour donation of $120 will contribute to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, microchip, deworming, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099 ",

For being a baby herself she was an excellent mommy. Mia is now spayed and vaccinated and ready for her new home. She is very affectionate and sticks to you like glue. She does well with dogs also. Mia can be a bit feisty with other cats. I think she gets overwhelmed by them. She would be ok in a home with one other cat. If you are interested in meeting/adopting Mia text me 315-440-0902.

Now this sweet girl is looking for a real forever home!\n\nJoJo is a high energy, playful girl with a curious nature. She's independent and not needy. JoJo is a vocal girl who loves to tell you when it's feeding time. JoJo is not exactly a lap kitty, but she always seems to want to be nearby. She is often on the move. She is a prowler, stalker, big cat at heart and can be somewhat dominant/resistant towards other cats so a good introduction to other kitties will be in order. JoJo is indifferent to dogs as long as they don't try too hard to be friends and \"stay in their doggo lane\" so to speak. If you are looking for a young playful kitty to love and want a lot of energy and have time for playful interaction daily, JoJo might be the perfect (and beautiful) kitty for you! She's vetted and litter box trained.\n\nYou must submit an application to be considered for adoption. We cannot reply to all inquiries, but respond to all no obligation applications. Fill out an application at https://webportalapp.com/sp/login/savinghopeanimalrescue-catapplicationportal It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. \n\n----------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\n\nOur cats are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in other states. These cats are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $575. This fee includes: Age-appropriate vaccinations, combo test, spay/neuter, microchip with registration, health certificate, and transport costs.\n\nAs a Saving Hope direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.",

He loves cuddling with his sibling and being loved all over. He's very calm and silly but would do best with another kitty friend. He is a sweet, fun boy. Pretty Boy has great litter manners.\n\nYou must submit an application to be considered for adoption. We cannot reply to all inquiries, but respond to all no obligation applications. Fill out an application at https://webportalapp.com/sp/login/savinghopeanimalrescue-catapplicationportal It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. \n\n----------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\n\nOur cats are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in other states. These cats are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $575. This fee includes: Age-appropriate vaccinations, combo test, spay/neuter, microchip with registration, health certificate, and transport costs.\n\nAs a Saving Hope direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.\n",

He was set to be euthanized, but we couldn't let that happen. We got Zephyr medial care and into a foster home, and this boy has blossomed!\n\nZephyr is a curious boy and warms up quickly to new people. While not a lap cat, he enjoys laying on your chest for head scratches pets. When he's not cuddling, he loves to bask in the sun or sit on the windowsill. Zephyr is a very playful boy. He could chase his wand toy and laser pointer all day. He is vocal and will let you know when he is hungry, wants to play, or just wants some love. Zephyr has perfect litter manners and is vetted. Zephyr would potentially do ok with another calm pet with very slow introductions. \n\nZephyr is FIV + which just means she has a compromised immune system and can't go outside. He will need her regular vet visits. This isn't contagious and is only spread by blood contact with only other cats. Zephyr is healthy and doing great. FIV+ cats can have very long and healthy lives with good care! It's nothing to be afraid of and we are happy to provide further information.\n\nYou must submit an application to be considered for adoption. We cannot reply to all inquiries, but respond to all no obligation applications. Fill out an application at https://webportalapp.com/sp/login/savinghopeanimalrescue-catapplicationportal It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. \n\n----------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\n\nOur cats are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in other states.

He originally wasn\u2019t very trusting of humans.  After being at a foster placement for months, he has turned into the biggest sweetheart. Still a little shy but can be picked up.  He has had 2 major ear surgeries and suffered some hearing loss because of that. He MUST be an indoor only cat.  \n\nKennedy gets along well with other cats.  It may help her transition better if she has a companion. \n\nHe has been neutered, tested negative for FIV/FELV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nSince he is at a foster placement, please complete an application.  Once it's approved, we'll make arrangements to meet Kennedy. \n\nhttps://cnysnap.org/adopt/\n",

I'm a very friendly little lap kitten, who loves to play--the purrfect family pet. I still have my brothers and sisters to play with, and we have endless energy and self confidence, but all of us want a home with at least one other playful cat or kitten to use our energy on. And of course, My siblings are still availabe for adoption and would love to be adopted in pairs. We're very creative, and keep the people who take care of us now laughing all day.\n\nAll Kittycorner kitties have been spayed or neutered (even little kittens like me) tested negative for Feline Leukemia and FIV ,Vaccinated. and microchipped.\n\nLove,\n\n~~To express an interest in adopting me please take the first step by filling out an adoption application for me at kittycorner.org under the Adoption tab, or at this link https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/ Please make certain that your email address is correct. With an accepted application KittyCorner will contact you by email to set up a time for you to come meet me. All KittyCorner cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee. If at any time for any reason I need to be returned/rehomed, please just return me to KittyCorner. They will happily take me back. KittyCorner wants to be sure that I will always have a safe place to stay. Thanks for considering adopting me!",

        "description": "Segovia Michelle was part of a large rescue of over 35 cats and dogs. Their caregiver was an avid animal lover who sadly suffered from mental illness and ended up taking her own life. It was quickly obvious to us that she poured a lot of love into her pets. We couldn't let them all go to the shelter so we were able to get them all into foster care!\n\nSegovia, or Siggy as she is affectionately called, is an affectionate lady. She is a bit reserved, and shy at first, but she loves \"her people.\" Definitely enjoys other cats with slow introductions, but she is not a big dog fan. If the dogs avoid her, she should be okay. She's very active at night and loves to play! She will occupy herself with every toy in sight. She does have a cute little meow. She likes to lick and gets very stimulated when petting. She's not necessarily a sit down and cuddle kind of kitty cause she's always on the move. We think with a given family, that could change, especially without dogs around and as many cats to fight for cuddle space lol. Definitely going to stay petite and more slender/long build. She is litter box trained. She was born mid February 2022.\n\nYou must submit an application to be considered for adoption. We cannot reply to all inquiries, but respond to all no obligation applications. Fill out an application at https://webportalapp.com/sp/login/savinghopeanimalrescue-catapplicationportal It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. Our cats are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in other states. These cats are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. Our out of state adoption fee is $575. This fee includes: Age-appropriate vaccinations, combo test, spay/neuter, microchip with registration, health certificate, and transport costs. As a Saving Hope direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.",

She would like more than anything to find another companion to comfort and love and to be loved in return. Cuddles prefers to be an only fur baby. She is currently on thyroid medication, but that does not affect her loving and affectionate personality.\n\nThanks to a grant from the Petfinder Foundation, this cat's adoption fee is reduced to just $50\u2014half-off our regular adult cat adoption fee! $20 will be added to this fee for cats who are microchipped.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw him on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

        "description": "Chloe was trapped outside and is feral. She does engage with the woman who has her, but she can't be petted, as of yet. She lives with two other cats, and despite trying, both cats bully her, so now she's living in the finished basement. \n\nAt this point, Chloe can't be re-released. She is a strictly indoor cat and needs someone willing to foster/adopt her. She has a sweet purrsonality and loves to play and look out windows. Would anyone be willing to give this little angel a chance?\n\nPlease contact Amy at (315) 753-9227 and/or Voice4TheVoicelessAdoptions@gmail.com for more information on how to adopt Chloe.",

She has patiently been waiting to get out of the shelter because the environment is a little too much craziness for this calm girl so she recently went to a foster home.  She has joined forces with another reserved girl named Paris. Sicily enjoys being pet, can be picked up and could be your next couch companion.  She is a professional lounger.  She will occasionally play with toys as well.\n\nWe would like Paris and Sicily to be adopted together.  Paris is a little more outgoing and likes to explore.  It is helpful to have these somewhat shy kitties together for comfort and support to help them adjust.  They would do best in a quieter, calm environment.\n \nShe has been spayed, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nSince she's in a foster placement, please submit an application and we can make arrangements to meet Sicily and Paris.\n\nLink to page with application:\nhttps://cnysnap.org/adopt/",

        "description": "Meet Mimi born late May 2023. HE came to us as a tiny baby from the Rio Grand Valley. Now he's ready for adoption!\n\nMimi is a sweet boy who likes to cuddle with his human and give kisses. He purrs so loudly when he cuddles that it will put all your worries at ease. He does well with other cats but is weary of dogs so a slow introduction is a must. Mimi will do well as a solo companion as well. He also likes to play and explore his house. He has excellent litter box manners.\n\nYou must submit an application to be considered for adoption. We cannot reply to all inquiries, but respond to all no obligation applications. Fill out an application at https://webportalapp.com/sp/login/savinghopeanimalrescue-catapplicationportal It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. \n\n----------------------PLEASE_READ-----------------------------Our cats are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in other states. These cats are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. Our out of state adoption fee is $575. This fee includes: Age-appropriate vaccinations, combo test, spay/neuter, microchip with registration, health certificate, and transport costs. As a Saving Hope direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.",

She will flourish in a quiet, loving home, preferably without other cats.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw the cat on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee of $120 contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, microchip, testing, deworming.\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/cat/bernice-72115437/ny/syracuse/cny-cat-coalition-ny392/",

        "description": "Vienna is a cat burglar. She was going from house to house crying at doors, wanting somebody to let her in. She really loves people and is as friendly and playful as she is beautiful. Vienna is a young cat who loves to play. She's confident, and seems to accept other cats with no more than a hiss or two. (In other words, A Normal reaction) but you can't predict how a cat will react with another cat. It's kind of like a blind date, but it's hard to predict how she might behave in a new situation. Fortunately, if she has any problems with another cat, she can be returned to KittyCorner at any time.\n\nVienna is a little cat with a sweet little face. She's friendly and loves attention and play. She would love a home with people who would give her lots of attention, and she'll pay you back many times over.\n\nHer health is good, and she's a young cat, maybe a little over a year old. She tests negative for Feline Leukemia and FIV, is vaccinated, microchipped, and of course she is spayed.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting Vienna, please take the first step by filling out an adoption application for her at kittycorner.org under the Adoption tab, or at this link https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/ Please make certain that your email address is correct. With an accepted application KittyCorner will contact you by email to set up a time for you to come meet me. All KittyCorner cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee.

        "description": "Meet Betsy Ross. I am friendly, outgoing, loving, affectionate, very sweet, and calm. I arrived here on the July 3, 2023. I was thought to be pregnant, and in fact I delivered the first of my 3 kittens in the car on the way home from a vet check on July 11, 2023. I'm about 1 year old with an approximate birth date of July 11, 2022. I've been a very good young mother to my kittens, and they even gave me a tiny orphan named Moxie that I raised on my own. What a joy! Now I'm ready to find a forever home for myself.\n\nBetsy Ross is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for FELV/FIV.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting her, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible, at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet her.\n\nYour donation of $100 will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.\n\n*All kittycorner.org kittens/cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee.

Beautiful Barbie is now waiting for her dream house.  Since she is fairly new to the shelter and still pretty young, she hangs out off to the side.  She does like to be pet and will stand up if you approach to draw your attention.  In a safe home of her own, she will have a chance to grow into a more confident cat.  \n\nShe has been spayed, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nEmail us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet this sweet little bashful Barbie.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.",

        "description": "Meet Mama Kim born mid 2021. Mama Kim and her babies were surrendered due to landlord' issues. We got them into foster care and now Mama Kim is ready for adoption!\n\nMama Kim is a very affectionate girl who wants to be involved in whatever you are doing. She loves to follow her foster parents around and flop on to her back to ask for belly scratches! She is always quick to greet them with a little meow and rub on their leg whenever she sees them, too! At night, you can typically find her curled up in bed at their feet. She gets along with other pets in the house, but can be slow to warm up at first, so slow, proper introductions are an absolute must. Kim also LOVES to play with her toys: especially the spring toys and catnip mice. She has perfect litter box manners and is wonderful about using her scratching posts. If you're looking for an adorable snuggle bug, she is your girl! She is fully vetted.\n\nYou must submit an application to be considered for adoption. We cannot reply to all inquiries, but respond to all no obligation applications. Fill out an application at https://webportalapp.com/sp/login/savinghopeanimalrescue-catapplicationportal It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. Fee includes vaccinations, combo testing, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\n----------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\n\nOur cats are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in other states. These cats are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $425. This fee includes: Age-appropriate vaccinations, combo test, spay/neuter, microchip with registration, health certificate, and transport costs.\n\nAs a Saving Hope direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.",

He is well socialized because he has been fostered with his siblings and other cats.  His siblings have all been adopted and Cooper is still waiting for his chance to find a home.  He's about 2 years old.   The person caring for him says he\u2019s a wonderful boy and would make a great addition to a family.  Although he doesn't like to be picked up, he's friendly and sleeps with both his cat friend Sheldon and their foster mom.\n\nSheldon is a male that's approximately 2 years old.  He's the one with a little white on his nose.  He's sweet and enjoys sleeping next to his foster mom plus spending time with his buddy Cooper.  They have been together for over a year and are good buddies.  Sheldon enjoys being pet and will let you know when he needs attention but isn\u2019t necessarily a lap cat.  He can be a little shy at times.\n\nWe would like Cooper and Sheldon to be adopted together.\n\nThey have been neutered, tested negative for FIV/FELV, microchipped and up to date on vaccines.  The adoption fee for cats over 6 months is $80 each.\n\nSince they are at a foster placement, please complete an application.  Once it's approved, we'll make arrangements to meet these cuties who aren't related but look like they are.  \n\nhttps://cnysnap.org/adopt/\n",

        "description": "Elias (with white whiskers,) and his brother, Grover, (with black whiskers,) came to KittyCorner when they were tiny kittens in February of 2021. They are brothers and best friends and were adopted together, but when their people became too ill to care for them any longer, the boys came back to us as part of our \"Lifetime Return Policy.\" We were delighted to see them all grown up as sleek, healthy young adults. And they are so well-adjusted. We kept them caged at first, but after their shots and tests were updated, and they were pronounced healthy, they regained their freedom.\n\nWe put them in our library. I know they felt abandoned, first when their adoptive Mom passed away, and then when their Dad had to bring them back. They were a little depressed at first, but they have wonderful attitudes. You could almost hear them saying \"Okay, we're in a different place, so we better explore and stake out some territory But the food is okay, and that other kitty is nice.\" (They live with an older kitty in their room for extra company) Elias is big, sleek and confident. Grover is a little smaller and likes to have huis brother around for confidence, but still likes people a lot and is very friendly.\n\nBoth boys love to play.\n\nThey have been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and have great personalities. They'd love a family who would love them and play with them and let them be a big part of their lives with lots of play and other stuff to do.\n\nFor a pair of perfect young adult cats who are ready to be a part of your family's lives, Please consider Elias and his brother, Grover (see his listing separately.) WE WANTED THEM TO STAY TOGETHER, BUT WE THNK THEY COULD EACH GO BY HIMSELF. Since they are very cat-friendly (with a proper introduction) they could probably learn to love a new kitty companion.\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting this fun and loving pair, OR ONE OF THEM BY HIMSELF, please take the first step by filling out an adoption application for them at kittycorner.org under the Adoption tab, or at this link https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/ Please make certain that your email address is correct. With an accepted application KittyCorner will contact you by email to set up a time for you to come meet them. All KittyCorner cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee. If at any time for any reason they need to be returned/rehomed, please just return them to KittyCorner. We will happily take them back. KittyCorner wants to be sure that They will always have a safe place to stay. Thanks for considering adopting them!",

        "description": "Binky is still waiting for her forever home!!! She recently went to a foster home so we could see how she was one on one. She loved being next to the person sitting on her lap always purring . We always thought she sisnt like other kitties turns out she is afraid of them . Binky is a sweet independent girl. She is between 2-3 years old. Loves to play and be in charge She loves to be the center of attention and starts purring the minute you talk to her.. She would do best by herself or with a pup. Binky has been spayed and is up to date with her shots. If you would like to meet little Binks please text or call Michelle (315)373-3077 or Lisa (315)727-2615",

        "description": "Brian was a feral kitten who was trapped with his two siblings in February 2022. His mom, Mia, was left outside for the winter when she had the kittens in an abandoned shed. Brian has spent several months with his foster mom getting to know that humans are not all bad. He is shy to new people, but once he gets to know you- especially if treats are involved- he is super loving! He occasionally will show his belly, he is full of purrs, and enjoys being brushed from time to time!\n\nBrian would do best in a quiet home with a loving and patient family.",

Ladybug can be pet and picked up but isn\u2019t fully litter box trained.  Lidia will come near people but is still a little scared to get too close. They are very friendly with each other and must be together.  They need a warm, safe shelter and food.  If someone is patient and works with them, Lidia may become people friendly  with time.  They could potentially become indoor/outdoor cats with the right person. \n\nThey have been spayed, microchipped, tested and are up to date on vaccines. \n\nEmail us at info@cnysnap.org if you\u2019re interested in this pair of \u201cbarn cats\u201d.",

        "description": "Meet Cooper, a handsome black and white tuxedo male cat with a medium-length coat. At around 15 months old, he's a wonderful feline who has had a challenging past, which makes him a bit wary of human touch. Despite this, he's not aggressive at all. Cooper is well-mannered and gets along splendidly with other cats. He's an energetic kitty with a love for play and a strong motivation for food. \n\nCooper has made significant progress and now allows full-body petting while he's eating. If you already have a lap cat and are seeking a companion for them, Cooper could be a perfect choice. He's a good boy who's in search of a permanent home.\n\nIf you're considering adopting two young cats, Cooper has a playmate named Little Patches. She's a young calico, primarily black and white, and they make an extraordinary pair!\n\nCould you be the perfect match for Cooper, ready to welcome him, and possibly Little Patches, into your home and heart? Please reach out if you feel Cooper, or both of them, could be a wonderful addition to your family.\n\nThanks to a grant from the Petfinder Foundation, this cat's adoption fee is reduced to just $50\u2014half-off our regular adult cat adoption fee! $20 will be added to this fee for cats who are microchipped.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw him on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099\n\n",

She\u2019s very curious about what people are doing, gets close but may run away if you move too fast.  She has been working on her confidence and is getting a little more comfortable being pet.  It will take a special person who is kind, plus willing to be patient while Violet learns she can trust people.   Being in a home with the same person(s) everyday may help her do that.  But someone will need to be okay if she never turns into a lap cat.  \n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, tested negative for FeLV/FIV and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nIf you want to meet the mysterious Violet, email us at info@cnysnap.org.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.",

He tends to get startled easily, so would probably appreciate a quieter home. He gets along very well with other cats and enjoys their company.

London was so terrified of being in the shelter at first but Paris loyally stayed by his side.  She was the first to venture and explore. Since her friend London was adopted, she has found a new buddy, Sicily (black & white cat in picture).  They are currently in a foster placement together to give them a break from the shelter.  Paris is a loyal friend and spends a great amount of time cuddling with Sicily.\n\nParis enjoys lounging in the enclosed catio at the shelter.  She is a little shy until she gets comfortable with someone.  She LOVES to be brushed and rolls around so you can even get her belly.  She enjoys pets, looking out the window and exploring new areas.  It seems she never had cat toys before because she was scared of them. But now she frequently plays.\n\nWe would like Paris and Sicily to be adopted together.  Paris is a little more outgoing and adventurous.  It is helpful to have these somewhat shy kitties together for comfort and support to help them adjust.  They would do best in a quieter, calm environment.\n \nShe has been spayed, tested negative for FeLV/FIV, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nSince she's in a foster placement, please submit an application and we can make arrangements to meet Paris and Sicily.\n\nLink to page with application:\nhttps://cnysnap.org/adopt/",

Many of the other kitties at Halo tend to pick on Katy\u2026maybe they are jealous of how pretty she is\u2026so she really needs to be in her own home where she can relax and be loved.\n\nIf you would like to meet Katy Purry you can  call HALO at 315-985-3738 to make an appointment or email us at haloadopt@gmail.com.\n\nPlease note: ages and info are guestimates based on vet info.

She does keep to herself as some of the bullies at HALO like picking on her because she doesn\u2019t fight back.  She has the absolute softest fur.  Blossom came to HALO from a farm with her three littke girls, who were all adopted out.  If you are looking for a quiet kitty companion and would like to meet Blossom you can call us at 315-985-3738 to make an appointment. You can also email us at haloadopt@gmail.com.",

It has to be done right and on her terms or she will shy away, but she can be very vocal and demand it! She has asthma that is well controlled, but can flare up rarely. She is good with other cats and dogs.",

        "description": "This beautiful gray and orange tabby is Dakota. \nDakota is sweet but shy young cat of approximately 1.5 years of age. \nDakota is the type of cat who likes to receive loving pets but is a little timid at first to ask for them. Once she is comfortable and settled in, she welcomes the love you have to give her. She is very gentle and calm. Dakota will do well either as an only cat or a home with another gentle and friendly cat. She would prefer a calm home to relax and enjoy herself. \nDakota is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, and tested negative for FIV/FeLV. \nPlease consider taking this nice but timid cat home today. \nEmail: adoptions@thenokillproject.org\n\nDakota\u2019s story: \n\nDakota was rescued last year during the colder months of spring. She was found wandering the road all by herself as a young kitten. A kind passerby saw her and contacted our organization for help. Dakota was placed in a foster home and initial vetting was done. As we began to take prepare her for adoption placement, her foster noticed that Dakota\u2019s belly was getting larger. It soon began to get very large and a trip to the vet was in order. It was at this point discovered that Dakota had wet FIP. \nFIP used to be a lethal diagnosis. Studies nowadays indicate that FIP can be treated with the help of an expensive but very successful treatment. The treatment is brutal, requiring 84 days of injections followed by an 84 day observation period. After the 168 days of treatment protocol is complete, the treated FIP cat is considered cured. Dakota went through her trials and tribulations and came out a winner! She survived FIP and she is now ready to move on and leave those terrible days of uncertainty behind. We would love to see this beautiful and gentle gal go to a home soon! ",

While she was always where we were, observing, she would not allow pets. Suddenly, she has decided that pets are pretty stinking awesome.  Just like that.  Now she demands pets from everyone.  Maybe she decided that if she didn\u2019t give it up she might never get a home of her own.  It\u2019s hard to imagine her leaving us, but it seems that she has decided she\u2019s ready to move on.\nIf you would like to meet Splash you can call us at 315-985-3738 to make an appointment or email us at haloadopt@gmail.com.",

His gentle nature will make him the perfect companion for anyone seeking a loyal and affectionate pet.  Sadly, someone left him on the street but he was rescued and brought to the shelter in June 2024.  Please don't keep him waiting for his forever home.  \n\nHe is FIV positive.

Tris is a very shy lady who generally doesn't ask for attention. She definitely appreciates a good pet when it is given to her though. Since entering the program Tris tested positive for FIV, Although this does affect her immune system, she is perfectly okay to house with other healthy cats.

        "description": "Meet Patrick Henry, an extremely playful and energetic 11-month-old kitten. When he was young, Patrick developed a feline herpes viral infection, which in cats gives them red, runny eyes and occasional nasal discharge. This is in no way related to human herpes and is not transmissible to humans. Actually, 90-95% of the feline population tests positive for feline herpes virus, but more than 50% show no symptoms. In fact, none of Patrick's littermates developed any symptoms, including his sister and companion, Abigail Adams, with whom he would like to be adopted.\n\nAt times of stress, Patrick may need to have his eyes treated with over-the-counter Artificial Tears; or if his nose gets stuffy, he might occasionally need to be put on a course of antibiotics, but even though Patrick was dealt this unlucky hand, he doesn't let it affect him in the slightest. No matter what is going on, I can assure you Patrick will be first on the scene to assess the situation. He is a very curious, cute kitten who will steal your heart as soon as you meet him. Do you have the desire to take this special kitten and his lovely, energetic sister, Abby, in open arms?\n\nPatrick has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, flea treated, and has tested negative for FeLV and FIV.\n\nTo express an interest in adopting him, you need to fill out our adoption application, including as much detail as possible, at https://kittycorner.org/adoption/application/. Please be sure that your email address is correct. If your application is accepted, KittyCorner will contact you via email to set up a time for you to come and meet him.\n\nYour donation of $100 per cat will contribute to the cost of veterinary care that the cat(s) received for all the above-mentioned procedures/treatments.\n\nKittyCorner is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR0279.\n\n*All kittycorner.org kittens/cats come with a lifetime \"cat-back\" guarantee. If at any time, for any reason they need to be returned/rehomed, please just return them to KittyCorner. We will happily take them back as our mission is to ensure that all our adoptees will always have a safe place to stay and call home.",

        "description": "Ideal emotional support cat for an introvert or someone with anxiety! Smokey is a sweet, friendly 2 year old neutered male cat. He is an American Shorthair, who gets along well with other nice cats (gets scared of territorial cats), and is also ok with nice dogs. He likes older kids if they are calm and gentle, but should not be around tiny tots as he could swat if scared or startled.\n\nSmokey is quite vocal and loves telling you all about his opinions. He wants to be around people all the time, and will follow you around and sleep on your bed if allowed. If left alone away from people, he cries from loneliness, so an owner who does not travel a lot is preferred. Smokey can be shy with strangers at first, so please give him a chance to get used to his new environment.\n\nSmokey is an indoor only cat that uses the litterbox and is fully vaccinated and de-wormed. He is quite allergic to fleas, so he should not be allowed outside and should have monthly flea treatments with Advantage 2, if you have other pets that go outside. Smokey also has sensitive skin, so a household that uses an air purifier is preferred.\nText Smokey's Foster Parent at 315-395-9262 if interested in adopting him. References and rehoming fee required. He comes with all vet paperwork.",

Miami absolutely loves to snuggle and would be perfectly content to just lounge in your lap all day. His favorite toy is a ball tower; he doesn\u2019t show much interest in any other toys. \n\nMiami does have an unknown skin allergy. It is not food related, and he takes half a tablet of Zyrtec daily to relieve the symptoms. But he is the *easiest* cat to give meds to! He\u2019ll let you gently pull his mouth open and toss it in, no problem.\"\n\nDOB 1/1/2022\n\nIf you are interested in this beauty or any of our other angels, you can complete an adoption application online at:\n\nhttps://kittenangels.org/adopt-3/\n\nPlease indicate on the adoption application that you are interested in Miami fostered by Emily T.\n\nPlease note, fosters do get final approval for any adoption as they are most familiar with the personalities of their foster kittens and cats.\n\nKitten Angels is a non profit, volunteer organization. We rely solely on fostering, volunteers, donations, and adoption fees. An adoption fee of $175.00 must be paid at the time of adoption by either cash or check. All of our adoptable animals are assessed in foster homes, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations and have been spayed or neutered and tested for FeLV/FIV. Medical records will be released with the adopted pet.",

A kind soul rescued him. She isn\u2019t able to keep him but has visited him at the shelter regularly since bringing him in during April 2024. She pets him and brings special treats.\n\nLincoln is terrified in the busy shelter. He needs a quiet home with a patient person that will let him adjust at his own pace. If you are an animal lover and want to help one that is really in need, think of Lincoln.\n\nHe is FIV positive. He still looks and acts like any other cat. FIV is only transmitted to other felines primarily through deep, penetrating bite wounds. His adoption fee has been waived because we just want him to find a good home.\n\nHe has been neutered, FeLV negative, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  Email us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet our shy Lincoln.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.\n",

        "description": "Cinderella came to Whiskers in 2017 as a one year old semi-feral mom cat who was caring for her kittens outside. Over the years she slowly learned to trust us humans and is now a gentle, relaxed cat that enjoys sitting on a shelf by a big window. \n\nShe likes to be pet and is the type of cat that would likely just hang out with you rather than snuggle. She also likes to hang out with other cats, but has never been seen snuggling with other cats. She would be okay as an only cat or living with other respectful cats at home. \n\nCinderella has a history of stomatitis and is on daily medication for it. She takes her medicine easily and it controls her condition well. She will do best in a quiet home with an experienced cat owner.\n\nDOB: 8/1/16\n\n==> Please follow these directions to be considered for adoption:\nApply at www.ewhiskers.com/apply\nPlease do not email\nPlease do not click on \"Start Your Inquiry\" on PetFinder.\n\nAll of Whiskers cats and kittens are spayed or neutered, age appropriately vaccinated and tested for FELV/FIV prior to adoption. Go to www.ewhiskers.com/apply to fill out our online adoption application.",

At one point Sammie must have had an accident because her tail had been broken, but healed, and also her leg. She is fine now, just has a barely noticeable limp.  Even with all she went through she still loves people, getting pets, and to snuggle on your lap.  Sammie would be best as an only kitty, and maybe an only pet all around.  She does currently take a happy pill every morning which helps her get along with all the other kitties at HALO.  She really does deserve a home after her ordeal on the streets.  If you would like to give her one you can call us at 315-985-3738 to make an appointment or email us at haloadopt@gmail.con.",

Unfortunately, life hasn't been so easy for him but we are hoping he can find the right home so he can live out his days as a much happier, thankful Tigger.  \n\nTigger's tragic story... he had already been neutered so he must have had a home at some point but was left out on the streets as a young cat, where he has been living for at least a year.  Someone was feeding him and trying to keep him alive but then had an injury that needed antibiotics.  Someone rescued him, got him treatment and a check up.  He was terrified and overwhelmed but has been getting more comfortable with the person that saved him.  They stated, \"he's gotten real sweet.\"  Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t keep him so he had to go to the shelter.  Given that he is still shy from his experiences, a quiet home without children and other animals would be best to help him feel safe.  \n\nHe is FIV positive.  He still looks and acts like any other cat. FIV is only transmitted to other felines primarily through deep, penetrating bite wounds.   His adoption fee has been waived because we just want him to find a good home.\n\nHe has been neutered, FeLV negative, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines.  \n\nEmail us at info@cnysnap.org or visit the shelter if you'd like to meet Tigger.\n\nVisit cats at our Cortland shelter:\nMonday: 5-7 p.m.\nTuesday: By appointment\nWednesday: By appointment\nThursday: 9-11 a.m.\nFriday: 9-11 a.m. & 6-7 p.m.\nSaturday: 11 a.m.\u201312 p.m.\nSunday: 4:30-5:30 p.m.\n",

Currently adjusting to the change of leaving her home of nearly 12 years, Sandy is taking some time to acclimate. At this time, she is not confident with interactions with humans and often feels scared and will hiss & growl. We are hopeful that this will improve with some love & patience. We anticipate uncovering more about her personality as she becomes more comfortable.\n\nSandy would likely thrive in a quiet home where she can indulge in leisurely lounging. If you have the heart and space to provide a comforting environment for Sandy, apply to welcome her into your home today!\n\nSandy is part of our Seniors for Seniors program, for adopters over the age of 65, her adoption fee will be waived.

        "description": "Sometimes, all it takes is one brave action to change your life for the better. Enchi did just that, as he choose to rescue himself one night after being either left behind, lost or dumped by his previous owner - he walked right into the home of our rescue's founder and up the stairs like he owned the place. It is unclear as to what Enchilada's past entails, but he had clearly been owned by people previously as was evidenced by an indent around his neck where a collar should have been, and his level of socialization and familiarity with people is much higher than that of a feral kitty. Despite hanging fliers and posting to multiple social media platforms in an attempt to find his family, no one came forward to claim poor Enchi. He has been through a lot, and is still hesitant, but does come and accept pets and nuzzle up on those who bring treats! He did very well with his grooming session, which involved removing several mats from his fur that had built up during his time outside. He's now looking and feeling much better, and needs a nice patient person to help him get back to being a happy house cat.\n\nEnchi's foster shared this about his favorite toys: \"Enchi loves the kitty pompoms. He goes crazy for them. I call it soccer. He picks it up in him mouth and has brought it to bed.\"\n\nEnchi does not do well with dogs, possibly as a result of living outdoors. He does however do very well with small kids and has been around a 2 year old and 4 year old that he was very patient with. \n\nEnchi is estimated to be between 2-3 years old, and did test positive for FIV, which should not affect his lifespan but does mean he should be a solo kitty so as to prevent risk of spreading the disease to other cats. We at TTRR are happy to discuss what it means to be FIV+ with any interested applicants! \n\nPer Enchi's foster 3/30/24: \"Enchi is a fluffy little guy that takes a second to get comfortable but when he is, he always wants head pets. He loves his morning wet food and regularly grooms himself as well! He is indoor trained, and usually likes to sleep a lot when no one is home and will want attention when someone he trusts is home. He does shed a bit, so please do have lint rollers and brushes available. He may seem skittish at first but patience and gentleness is always the best course of action with him. He seems most comfortable when people are relaxing or laying down furthermore solidifying him as a true couch potato. Treats are always appreciated by him too!\"\n\nPer Enchi's foster 5/12/24: \"Enchi is always looking for attention now and truly has come out of his shell. He is quite chatty and meows at you for pets and really enjoys being near his people. He is a great biscuit maker as well.\"\n\nPer Enchi's foster 6/6/24: \"Enchilada is a chill kitty. After he has his food. He's very affectionate and will show you by licking you many times. He enjoys making biscuits.

Initially, our plan was to TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) him, but Monroe had different plans for his future.\n\nThis sweet and gentle soul won us over with his affectionate nature and loving personality. Monroe is not just another cat; he's a furry bundle of joy looking for a forever home where he can share his love and receive it in return.\n\nMonroe enjoys cozy naps in sunny spots, playful moments with toys, and, most importantly, being the center of attention. His endearing tabby markings make him a true standout, and his expressive eyes tell a story of resilience and hope.\n\nDespite his diagnosis of FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus), Monroe is overall healthy and full of life. It's important to note that he may prefer to be the sole feline in the household. While he is an absolute sweetheart with humans, he may not be as fond of sharing his space with other cats.\n\nMonroe is ready to leave the past behind and embark on a new chapter filled with love and companionship in a home where he can be the one and only. Having been through tough times, Monroe is looking for a special someone who understands his unique needs and is ready to make him the center of their world.\n\nAre you the one to give Monroe the solo attention he craves? Come meet this delightful tabby, and let your heart be captured by the magic of Monroe! Adopt Monroe, and make every day a special one with this lovable feline friend.\n\nTo apply:\nhttps://forms.gle/Xb9FYyvMfkuDYKwf6",

This handsome guy is only 10 months old and is hopeful to finally have a family. He was born a barn cat that wasn't wanted and has never had a family of his own. Although he was born a barn cat, he is quite a social butterfly! \n\nUnfortunately, Bow has tested positive for FeLV on an ELISA test. BUT WAIT, before you let that discourage you from adopting, check out this fact sheet that includes new information regarding FeLV and how many cats can still live healthy and happy lives after a positive ELISA test. https://www.alleycat.org/resources/feline-leukemia-virus-felv/?print_this\n\n***Bow will not be able to be adopted into a home with cats that are not already FeLV positive. He was surrendered with his friend Valentine, who has also tested positive on an ELISA test if you are hoping for a multi-cat home! We would love to see them find a forever home together!  \n\nIf you are interested in Bow, please fill out a cat adopter survey on our website! https://www.yateshumane.org/cat-adopter-survey\n\nAdoption comes with:\n*Spayed/Neutered\n*Up to date on Vaccinations\n* Microchipped\n*Tested for FIV/FELV\n*Flea Treated\n*Dewormed\nCall us at (315)536-6094 or email contacthsyc@gmail.com for more information",

        "description": "PLEASE READ IN FULL! \nMiss Valentine wants to know if you're in need of a forever valentine! She would be happy to oblige! This little cutie is only 6 months old and is hopeful to finally have a family. She was born a barn cat that wasn't wanted and has never had a family of her own. Although she was born a barn cat she is as sweet as pie! \n\nUnfortunately, Valentine has tested positive for FeLV on an ELISA test. BUT WAIT, before you let that discourage you from adopting check out this fact sheet as it includes new information regarding FeLV and how many cats can still live healthy and happy lives after a positive ELISA test. https://www.alleycat.org/resources/feline-leukemia-virus-felv/?print_this\n\n***Valentine will not be able to be adopted into a home with cats that are not already FeLV positive. She was surrendered with her friend Bow who has also tested positive on an ELISA test, if you are hoping for a multi-cat home! We would love to see them find a forever home together!  \n\nIf you are interested in Valentine, please fill out a cat adopter survey on our website! https://www.yateshumane.org/cat-adopter-survey\n\nAdoption comes with:\n*Spayed/Neutered\n*Up to date on Vaccinations\n* Microchipped\n*Tested for FIV/FELV\n*Flea Treated\n*Dewormed\nCall us at (315)536-6094 or email contacthsyc@gmail.com for more information",

Cuddles who was her previous owners companion and comfort kitty came into rescue after her owner passed away. She would like more than anything to find another companion to comfort and love and to be loved in return. Cuddles prefers to be an only fur baby. She is currently on thyroid medication, but that does not affect her loving and affectionate personality.\n\nThanks to a grant from the Petfinder Foundation, this cat's adoption fee is reduced to just $50\u2014half-off our regular adult cat adoption fee! $20 will be added to this fee for cats who are microchipped.\n\nApply online at cnycatcoalition.org/adoption/adoption-application (say you saw him on Petfinder).\n\nYour adoption fee contributes to the cost of veterinary treatments the cat has received, such as spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccines, testing, deworming medication, and flea and ear mite treatments.\n\nCNYCC is a New York State Registered Shelter/Rescue, Registration Number: RR099",

I am a very sweet, special needs 3-year-old boy looking for the puuurfect home!\n\nYou see, I have moderate/high level Cerebellar Hypoplasia, C.H. for short. C.H. is a neurological disorder that impacts my mobility. I wobble around, I fall down, and sometimes I am all over the place; this is why someone with prior experience with my condition would be best! \n\nMy perfect home would be one that is single story, potentially with older children who would show me love, and one where someone will be with me most of the day. I do love bunny hopping into your lap and stealing ALL of your attention. \n\nI get along with other cats, but I am not fond of dogs. With my condition, either one other cat friend or being the only cat in the house, would be best. Someone who works from home or someone who is able to have someone home 24 hours per day would be ideal as I am VERY accident prone and could seriously hurt myself if I'm not monitored constantly. I would also need to be confined in a safe room at night when you're sleeping so I don't get hurt. \n\nAll I want to do is play like crazy and cuddle you during the night!",

        "description": "Trevor the Tabby is a handsome young fella who somehow found himself on his own on the city streets, where humans and other cats were not kind to him.\u00a0 Now, in better circumstances, Trevor has gotten his mojo back!  He might need a bit of time to adjust to new surroundings.  Once he\u2019s comfortable, Trevor will be happy to cuddle with you at night and keep you entertained with his silly antics.  \n\nTrevor 2 is a year old with a chocolate tabby coat and beautiful green eyes.  He is a very interactive boy who is talkative and chirpy. Trev is affectionate with people and snuggles in for petting.  He greets his foster mom when she comes home from work and rolls onto his back for tummy rubs. He likes to entertain you by chasing his tail.  Occasionally he steals your pen or your straw, and he loves his cat toys too.  \n\nTrevor is taking medication to keep asthma under control, and he has been nice and stable for some time! He\u2019s not fussy about his food and is a good eater.  He also has very neat litter box habits.  \n\nTrevor is FIV+, but you would never know it!  Most cats with this slow-acting virus live healthy, active lives. They can safely live with other cats and people too.  We think Trevor2 makes a great ambassador for other FIV+ kitties! Please let us know if you would like a copy of our FIV info sheet. \n\nTrevor isn\u2019t fond of other cats and will do best as the only kitty in the household. He is quite intrigued by the household beast (dog), who is respectul of him. We think Trevor would be ok with older kids who will let him come to them first.  \n\nTrevor 2 is such a sweet boy who loves to be close to you. He will follow you around and ask you about your day, and is a very happy  young cat. He\u2019s a curious boy too, and you\u2019ll see him poking his nose around the desk when you\u2019re working. \n\nIf you think Trevor might be your guy, please send in an application from our website.  \n\nhttps://www.orangestreetcats.org/adopt.html\n\nor email us at: \n\nosc@orangestreetcats.org\n\n\nNote: Orange Street Cats is currently following a foster-to-adopt model in place of an in-person meeting prior to adoption. You will provide a foster home to the cat you are interested in adopting for a trial period. This gives you and your family an opportunity to be sure this is a good fit before you make the commitment to adopt. Our adoption team is available during and after the transition period to make sure our adopters and our cats are happy together!",

I find myself in need of a new home after being surrendered due to the passing of my beloved owner. Life has taken its toll on me, leaving me feeling a little sad, but I believe there is hope for a brighter future. I get along great with other cats and I love affection I just take a minute to come out to greet you. I hope to see you soon!",

        "description": "Meet Calcifer, a special kitten in search of a compassionate and experienced caregiver!\n\nCalcifer's unique condition involves neurological trauma, which requires him to receive hand expression 2-3 times daily for both urination and defecation. Currently, he is being fostered by a skilled veterinary technician who understands his needs. An individual with prior experience in expressing bladders would be best suited to provide the specialized care Calcifer requires.\n\nDaily medications are also part of Calcifer's routine. They can be easily administered by mixing them into his food, aiding in smoother expression and managing his mega-colon. Fortunately, Calcifer eagerly devours his wet food, making medication a breeze. Despite his condition, Calcifer is an active little kitty who can run, jump, and play just like any other feline companion.\n\nWhile Calcifer may be a bit shy initially, he quickly adjusts to people and forms strong bonds once he feels comfortable in his home. Other animals do not seem to bother him once he settles in. If you have a nurturing heart and the experience to meet Calcifer's special needs, he will be forever grateful for a loving and understanding forever home.\n\nApprox.  DOB:  11/3/2022\n\n==> Please follow these directions to be considered for adoption:\n       Apply at www.ewhiskers.com/apply\n       Please do not email\n       Please do not click on  \"Start Your Inquiry\" on PetFinder.\n\nAll of Whiskers cats and kittens are spayed or neutered, age appropriately vaccinated and tested for FELV/FIV prior to adoption.  Go to www.ewhiskers.com/apply to fill out our online adoption application.",

In his unassuming presence, we find a reminder to embrace the understated beauty that surrounds us and to cherish the quiet, genuine connections that enrich our lives.\n\nBuddy Boy would be the perfect addition to anyone that needs a friend, one that does not talk back, or disagree with any of your opinions. Get your brush ready, because he sure loves to be brushed. \n\nBuddy Boy has FeLV and FIV, two viruses that affect his immune system. Do you have a friend that has a poor immune system? Buddy Boy is like that friend that can get sick easier then another cat with a better immune system. With good vet care, and the know to take him in for a cold is all he really needs. \n\nPlease open your hearts to him.",

        "description": "Samson is a big cat with a big personality!  His personality is so big, it needs to be contained with a daily dose of Prozac, but he's good about taking his meds. We suspect that when he was younger he was handled roughly and he learned that the way to communicate with people is to give them a swat when he wants more attention or a nip when he doesn't want you to stop petting him.  He absolutely loves people and will follow you around like a dog.  He has great confidence and is not the type of cat to hide when you have guests over.  In fact, he will likely inspect any and all guests and look for pets from them too.  The more pets the better in Samson's mind!\n\nSamson needs a cat-savvy person who will have the patience to work with him on behavior modification.  He would like to be the only cat in the home because he demands all of the attention from the humans, but with his personality you will only need one cat.  His ideal home will be adult-only since he himself is the size of a small child and his personality would not mix well with children.  \n\nHe is a volunteer favorite and they say they've never met a cat quite like him before.  Come meet him and see for yourself!\n\n\n\nApprox. DOB: 12/03/2021\n\n==> Please do not email\n==> Please do not click on \"Ask About\"\n==> If you are interested in adopting or have questions, please apply at www.ewhiskers.com/apply\n\nWhiskers cats and kittens are ALL rescued from the surrounding CAPITAL DISTRICT. All of Whisker's cats and kittens are spayed or neutered, age appropriately vaccinated and tested for FELV/FIV prior to adoption. Go to www.ewhiskers.com/apply to fill out our online adoption application.",

        "description": "The day is finally here! We are now accepting adoption applications for Presley! If you aren\u2019t aware, Presley came to us by way of the Binghamton Police Department back in January after being found injured in the middle of a street unable to move. Presley had suffered a diaphragmatic hernia as a result of his injuries, but is now all healed up and ready to find his purrfect forever home! Presley does have some very minor mobility issues with his back legs after suffering severe trauma from being struck by a vehicle, but trust us when we say that in no way stops him from being your everyday cat! Presley can easily walk, RUN, drift around corners with ease, and can even manage to jump up onto surfaces that are lower to the ground. Presley will have to go to a special home that can accommodate his special needs, while also keeping in mind he is still your typical rambunctious young kitty boy who will need to have his energy drained appropriately so as to avoid any unwanted mischief. \nIf you are interested in potentially adopting Presley, please complete and send in our adoption application for our sanctuary staff to review. Applications can be found on our website here: www.speakanimalhospital.org/forms. Completed applications may be submitted to our email at speakoffice@aol.com. Please keep in mind we are still conducting all adoptions by appointment only. Thank you!\n",

Details about our adoption process and our adoption policies can be found on our website - www.FelineAdvocatesComingTogether.org\n\n\nAlexander and Matilda are still looking for their forever home! They've been with us for over a year!\n\nThese kitties are not related, but have become best feline friends in foster care!\nAlexander is a handsome and sweet cream-colored boy who is about 1.5 years old. He is a wobbly cat and a bit clumsy, but he has a great attitude and doesn't let this hold him down! He is good at getting himself onto furniture, and is also good about getting into and the litter box. Stairs could be challenging for him, unless they are carpeted. He is so funny and lovable and will make a great companion!\n\nMatilda is his friend and cuddle buddy. She is about 6 years old and FIV positive. She is healthy and has had a recent dental cleaning. With regular vet care, she should have a long and healthy life. She is shy around people, but she can be pet. She doesn't have a mean bone in her body! With time and attention she will continue to enjoy attention more and more, but for now she is happy to just snuggle with Alexander! She loves mealtime and she has an adorable meow when she is hoping for food!\n\nThey are both spayed/neutered and up-to-date on vaccines. Alexander is FeLV/FIV negative, and Matilda is FeLV negative and FIV positive.",

She is still learning what being an indoor cat looks like and will be happiest with a family who understands her preference for love on her own terms. She is curious and she enjoys exploring at night while I read on the couch. She will occasionally jump next to me for a moment -but just a moment, for now.\n\nCallie absolutely adores her companion cat here and needs a home with a companion for her that will make her feel safer and help show her how to live a domesticated life. \n\nCallie (DOB 01/01/2019) is spayed, has had all her age appropriate vaccinations, and is litter trained. \n\nCallie has also tested positive for FIV+, and so Kitten angels recommend that this cat be adopted as an only pet or as a companion for another FIV + kitty.\n\nHave questions about FIV+ Kitten Angels recommends these resources:\n\n\nIf you are interested in this beauty or any of our other angels, you can complete an adoption application online at: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqB5Evy4iJaqhuZETM8nOQeyZ837APlevp5spSB0wOg9E3jQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\nPlease indicate on the adoption application that you are interested in Callie fostered by Kashmir.\n\nPlease note, fosters do get final ok for any adoption even if approved through Kitten Angels as they are the ones most familiar with their foster kittens personalities.\n\nFor more information, please email adoptions@kittenangels.org\n\nKitten Angels is a non profit, volunteer organization.

        "description": "S-S-Smokin\u2019 Queen Sheba is looking for a special forever-after home. \n\nSheba is a pretty 10 year old dilute tortoiseshell who was recently diagnosed with diabetes at her annual vet visit. While we are hoping for someone who already has experience with this disease, TASP is also willing to train someone. Both her shots and the blood level tests are relatively easy tasks, but it is important to have a schedule where you will be able to feed her grain-free food and then administer the shots twice a day, 12 hours apart.\n\nSheba has adapted very well to her new regimen, and actually initiates it as part of her meal routine now, along with some lovin\u2019 of course. She is eating her new food like a champ and also enjoys a few freeze-dried treats at bedtime.\n\nNow let me tell you a little about her sparkling personality. She is a smart and quirky cat, downright hilarious at times. Unlike many cats who will just give you a blank stare, Sheba actually responds to \u201cno\u201d and \u201cback\u201d commands. She has a snowman bed, but she chooses to sleep on top of it, rather than inside. When she puts her paws up on your leg, it means, she has designated this as your cuddle time. Like most cats, she enjoys sleeping during both the day and night, but also enjoys her playtime. While Sheba does like to chase balls or wrestle with some toys, she also amuses herself with cardboard juice or milk cartons, paper and aluminum foil. She hasn\u2019t yet shared with us who or what these imaginary friends are, but she sure has a great time socializing with them. As a matter of fact, these are the only playmates she desires; she does not want to share even larger common areas with another pet. She loves the attention of humans though, known or new. She really misses having the company of her own human to rub against and purr to, and who could dote on her with some good conversation and pets in return. \n\nAre you the kind soul this pretty girl is waiting for? If so, please fill out our application http://www.theanimalsupportproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Adoption-Application_TASP_PDF.pdf",

        "description": "Sprinkles is a special kitty in search of a special home. Sprinkles is a 5 year-old gal who is looking for a quiet home with someone who is patient and understands her. You see, Sprinkles came to us as a very unhappy kitty with trauma to her hind end; upon exam, our wonderful vet believed she may have been kicked or stomped by a previous owner. As a result, she has difficulty grooming around her tail and back legs, so she sometimes develops matting there. But besides daily glucosamine, she is able to run and jump like any other kitty. Sprinkles also takes a bit to warm up to new people and is understandably anxious around loud noise and fast movements - so a quiet home without small children would probably be best for her. She has lived around a small dog who she ignores as well as cats; however, she does get picked on by more confident kitties. Sprinkles is very smart though and can use a cat door. Once comfortable, she just wants to be around her people, and is very chatty and loves to rub noses with her humans. So if you are looking for a best friend and believe you can provide this pretty girl with the safe and loving home she deserves, please send an email to schedule a visit and come meet her!",

She is crate trained, housebroken, loves to ride in the car and stick her head out the window, and loves playing in running water. The hose and the shower are two of her favorite things. Additionally, she loves to sunbathe on the deck. \nLittle would do best with a person, couple or family who is active and likes to be outside with a fenced yard. She prefers to be the only dog who can get all of your attention. Due to her size, she would do best with older children and an experienced owner who will take the time to work with her and understand her cues. She doesn\u2019t communicate like a normal dog but she does tell you what she wants / needs if you pay attention. She is incredibly intelligent and loyal. She will stick by your side wherever you go.

        "description": "Name: Murphy\nBreed: Collie Pyrenees Mix\nAge: 1 year\nDisposition: Working breed\n\nAbout Murphy:\nMurphy is a one-year-old Collie Pyrenees mix who is looking for a home where he can put his working breed instincts to use. He is an active and intelligent dog who thrives on having a job and purpose in life.\n\nPersonality:\nMurphy is a dedicated and hardworking dog with a strong work ethic. He is known for his intelligence and is quick to learn and follow commands. He is an alert and attentive companion who is always ready for a task. While he may be serious and focused during work, he can also be affectionate and loyal to his human companions.\n\nWork and Job Requirements:\nAs a working breed, Murphy requires a home where he can have a job or specific tasks to engage his mind and energy. This could include activities such as herding, agility training, or participating in dog sports. Murphy will excel in an environment where he is given the opportunity to work and use his natural instincts. Regular mental and physical stimulation is essential for his overall well-being.\n\nTraining:\nMurphy is a highly trainable dog due to his intelligence and eagerness to work. He will benefit from consistent and positive reinforcement training methods. With the right guidance and training, he can become a well-behaved and reliable companion. Engaging in activities that challenge his mind and provide structure will help fulfill his working breed needs.\n\nActivity Level:\nMurphy has a high activity level and requires regular exercise to stay happy and content. Daily walks, runs, or engaging in activities that simulate his working instincts will help burn off his excess energy. Providing him with sufficient physical exercise and mental stimulation will contribute to his overall happiness and prevent behavioral issues that may arise from boredom.\n\nIdeal Home:\nMurphy would thrive in a home where his working abilities can be utilized. Owners who have experience with working breeds or have a background in dog training would be well-suited for him. A home with a large securely fenced yard or access to open spaces would be ideal. Murphy needs an owner who understands his needs for mental and physical stimulation and is committed to providing him with a purposeful life.\n\nIf you are looking for a dedicated and active companion who thrives on having a job, Murphy might be the perfect match for you.

Transports run every few weeks and we will have the dog on the next available transport once approved. If you are not able to accept a dog until a specific time period, please apply at that time************\n\nWe are a volunteer run rescue and donate our time to these dogs. IF you are not serious about moving forward in our adoption process, please do not apply. If someone other than yourself is part of the decision making process, please make sure you have spoken with them and they are on board. We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nButtercup, 2yr old, spayed female, pitbull mix, 51 pounds. Buttercup resides in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nButtercup was saved from the county shelter and was housed with another dog, and went into a foster home with other pups. She was able to do integrate well but, because of her hearing impairment, she gets startled easily and becomes very defensive when surprised. It is not that she cannot be around other dogs but she needs time to feel comfortable and secure before letting her guard down. To alleviate this, we have found putting up a fence/x-pen and allowing her to see/\"meet\" the dogs before being let loose with them works best for Buttercup. \n\nButtercup has learned some basic obedience using hand signals and tactile marks, and has learned to connect seeing other dogs with a long tap on her right shoulder. Her ideal home would be one who sees her hearing challenges as an opportunity to connect on a deeper level with her and will take the time to train Buttercup, whether on their own or through professional courses.\n\nButtercup is very human friendly and affectionate. She's a gentle lovebug working to navigate her way through this world with the guidance of her human. She would do best with kids 10 years or older due to her size and hearing issues, which may result in her being startled by young kids. \n\nButtercup is a solid 4/10 level dog - she can be playful and excited but her default is to sit back and watch, assess. She is well mannered and doesn't beg, and is overall easy to handle on the leash, with minimal reactivity on walks. She is fully house and crate trained, and enjoys snoozing in bed or riding in a car for adventures.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nInterested in applying to adopt her?

        "description": "Meet Ella: The Three-Legged Wonder Dog (Looking for a Forever Adventure Buddy!)\n\nHowdy there! My name's Ella, and let me tell you, I'm a firecracker of a pup!  Life started out a little ruff \u2013 me and my best bud, Ava, were found all alone at an abandoned house. We then landed at a shelter, but let's just say country livin' wasn't quite the life for energetic pups like us. Especially since space was tight, and you know, the whole \"risk of euthanasia\" thing wasn't ideal. Thankfully, we were then moved over to Saving Grace until a home comes along.\n\nBut hey, that's all in the past! Now I'm on the hunt for my forever home, and let me tell you, it's gotta be full of fun and adventure.  I may be missing a leg (don't worry, it doesn't slow me down one bit!), but my spirit is bigger than life! I may be three-legged, but I have the energy of four!  Walks in the park or just cuddling on the couch - I am down for all!\n\nWhile I adore my pal Ava (who also needs a home), we also enjoy time apart.  I am happy to shower a new family with all the love I've got.  \n\nSo, if you're looking for a vibrant, fun-loving pup who's ready to conquer every walk and cuddle session with enthusiasm, then look no further!  Don't be discouraged by my missing leg \u2013 my heart and spirit are full, and I'm ready to fill your life with endless joy.  Please contact Saving Grace and tell them you want to meet Ella, the three-legged wonder dog, and let's start our forever adventure together!\n\n********************************************************************************************************\n\nWatch these videos of Ella playing (copy and paste into your browser):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/g_BA-p4VrS8\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rIf50FjgiRs\n\nPlease consider adopting a special needs pet.

She has gotten used to other dogs over time, but she is blind so she enjoys having her personal space with other dogs, too! Prin is housetrained as well! She does have diabetes, so her adopter would need to do injections for her to keep her happy and healthy! Prin is currently resting comfortably in a foster home, but give us a call to find out more!

        "description": "Nugget is a chihuahua Jack Russell mix that came to us needing a little help with his training since he was acting out with some very negative attention seeking behaviors. We weren't going to give up on him as his previous owners did when they took him to a shelter to be euthanized at just 10 months old when he was showing signs of a high play drive and becoming nippy to elicit attention the only way he knew how.  It has been a long process including a 2 week stay and train program at click to zen to lay down a foundation for him of positive reinforcement training and basic manners. He has been responding very well to his training but it needs to continue once he is placed into a new foster to adopt home. This little 10# Jack Russel terrier mix is super smart and he learns very quickly so we think he can continue to be taught new tricks and manners as he continues to grow into such a good boy. His foster mom wrote the following bio in hopes that we can find Nugget a great new foster to adopt home. Please be sure to read all about him before applying since he is needing a specific type of forever home?\nNugget has been hard at work after his two week long board and train. He has been getting consistent, daily (and usually nightly during the work week) brief training sessions from his foster mom. \nNugget has come a long way and is working hard along side his foster mom to learn all the world has to offer. From living in a rural area, to learning all of the scary sounds in the city. Nugget\u2019s foster mom is working on desensitizing him with many different sounds every day. He has learned to not be scared of the hair dryer, food processor, kitchen Aid mixer, and now and working on the vacuum. \nThey have been working every night, refreshing on the basics he learned at his board and train like place, settle (lay down), come, and leave it. \nAs well as slowly teaching him to sit, heal, and to be more tolerable towards the cats, and to be respectful towards his larger foster dog sister. Nugget enjoys playing with other dogs he knows and is comfortable with, but does not like to share his toys. So he may be best in an only dog home, or at least separated/crated when left by himself as to not be overstimulated, and have time to himself to decompress.\nNugget has a high prey drive, and will chase anything running fast. So he would do best in a home without any cats, a fenced in yard, or if no fenced in yard, to have him securely leashed when walked. Due to his past history with children, and his tendency towards hyperactivity, he would do best in a home with older children, and adults.\nHe is very well crate trained and does not mess in his crate, and is working very well at potty training. \nIn the beginning, Nugget had had difficulty socializing with new humans and animal. It takes him a little extra time to meet someone in order to start to feel comfortable with them. When staying with his foster family, Nugget has slowly been able to be introduced to some new people inside and outside of the home, and is improving his social skills.\nHe does love to play with his toys with his humans, but does not like to share with other animals. He likes to keep his bones to himself, and may feel intimidated if someone tried taking it from him, but is working on \u201cleave it\u201d means it\u2019s okay to give up our bone and we will be rewarded.\nNugget loves to cuddle next to his human, or on top of them if he can. He truly loves and clings to his one human and looks to them for reassurance, as well as may become a little protective over them, so his human will have to keep up with consistent training to reinforce his positive behaviors.  \nNugget will need continued training following his adoption to be successful and continue positively moving forward. Nugget would love to learn with you!\n\nAn adoption donation of $450 is being asked to cover a small portion of his veterinary, training and care fees. For more information, go to allcreaturesbigandsmall.org and email a completed adoption application to meowchatz@hotmail.com.\n\nPlease copy and paste a completed adoption application from our homepage with your inquiry if you would like a response back. We get dozens of emails and phone calls each day with only an hour of \"free time\" to volunteer and answer them around our full-time jobs and family life...don't let your inquiry get passed by because of an incomplete application. Thanks in advance for your help!\n\nHelp our rescue by donating to our \"Spay the momma fund\". When adopting one of our babies, if each new family would contribute an extra $10 we can help out that babies mother by assisting with the cost of her spay. Help turn the momma into a pet rather than a breeding factory, donate today! \n\nAdoptions limited to a 500 mile radius of Pulaski, NY and pets must be viewed in person by all family members prior to adoption; animals will not be shipped to their new homes.

Don't let his serious looking pictures fool you - he does smile A LOT (just not for the camera!) and he is a very happy, friendly guy who is house trained and well behaved. Arnold is a very energetic and active dog, who is eager to learn, listens well and is extremely smart and sensitive, which makes him a dream to work with. He needs guidance and leadership, but with a soft touch. Arnold could excel at almost anything (dog sports, tracking, agility) and needs an adult only home with someone who will take the time to keep his mind and physical needs busy, in return he will be the most amazing companion ever. He has been introduced to a few female dogs and has done very well with them and would need a meet and greet if you have another dog. ",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL TARNISOAPS1@AOL.COM.\n\nPrincess is 3 years old, healthy, medium-sized for the breed, white pit bull. \n\nFrom what our rescue knows, she was found abandoned and tied up on Harlem\u2019s streets. At some point she went through to a second initial owner and she was either abused there or originally (or both). She was surrendered for being snippy at people and exhibiting fearful behavior. At the same time, she has shown affection toward people, is very interested in play, and walks, and has a lot of youthful energy. She was pulled into our because of that potential. \n\nShe walks on lead but requires good lead skills and treats or toys to help guide her through the walk. She takes treats and toys from human hands especially in a less stressful situation than she is in now. She rode in cars and interacted with toys and people positively. Her behavior was better initially but is naturally increasingly compromised by crating and current stress of foster home. She should ideally be having more 1 on 1 attention / training with a breed experienced person and less resident pets near her to react to. \n\nShe is not good with cats and small dogs and she needs to be in an adult only, experienced and dog savvy home. \n\nPlease note that this is a courtesy posting and Princess is not at our shelter but is in a rescue. If you are interested in more information about her, please contact tarnisoaps1@aol.com",

SHE REQUIRES SOMEONE WHO IS ABLE TO VISIT THE SHELTER IN DELHI, NY MULTIPLE TIMES TO MEET & GAIN HER TRUST PRIOR TO ADOPTING HER. SHE WOULD DO BEST IN A COUNTRY SETTING THAT IS QUIET AND WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS A QUIET LIFESTYLE\n\n***Serious inquiries only please from those who are experienced dog handlers with no children and no other pets***\n\nLayla\u2019s Foster Mom describes her as the classic \u201cHuge-Personality-in-a-Small-Package\u201d kind of dog, and she is a tiny bundle of bustling energy. She is about 35 \u2013 40 pounds and is about 6 years old. \n\nLayla is very SWEET, AFFECTIONATE and FUNNY with people she knows and trusts, but it will take many visits and lots of patience with her as she is very wary and nervous when it comes to meeting new people. When she is around people who she doesn't know, she can get very anxious and overly excited, and it takes quite a bit of time for her to be able to settle down so she is not stressed. \n\nAnyone who wants to meet her will need to be committed to setting up appointments to come to the shelter many times to gain her trust slowly. She needs to be in a quiet and low traffic, adult-only home with no children. Her adopters will also need to be experienced dog handlers and know how to manage her behavior when she is outside her comfort zone, as she will need ongoing help navigating new environments and situations. Her adopter(s) will also always need to closely manage her interactions with anyone new. \n\nLayla\u2019s Foster Mom enjoys Layla\u2019s weekly overnight home visits and says she is house-trained and crate-trained and knows basic commands (come, sit, down, wait). She likes to go for walks and does well on the leash, and she is great in the car. She loves chewy toys, bones and playing fetch (although she's still working on the bringing it back part of fetch ?), and she is also capable of just hanging out and relaxing. She is extremely food motivated so training her will be easy, and she is eager to learn and please you - most of all, she wants YOUR attention and being petted is her favorite reward!  \n\nWhile we feel that she would be best in a home as the only pet, we think it is possible that she might get along with a very mellow large male given time and proper introductions. We know the list of requirements is long and Layla is not the dog for everyone, but we are hoping to find the right home that sets her up for success and helps her thrive. In return this QUIRKY and LOVING girl promises to become your BEST FRIEND FOREVER!!!\n\n***Serious inquiries only please from those who are experienced dog handlers, no children and no other pets and be willing to visit the shelter in Delhi, NY multiple times to meet and gain her trust prior to adopting her.***\n\nSERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY.

Saved from the ACC last SEPTEMBER - she is still seeking a perfect forever life with some special people. \nGood with dogs, kids and cats - Sadie is short, sleek,  cute and everything inbetween. Currently with a foster near Binghamton, NY - she is now around 11 months old - we have noticed Sadie is a little selective in her hearing - if on purpose or not she gets along just fine, but  definitely something to be aware of.  She loves to snuggle and play - full of your typical puppy personality!\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, de-wormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heart-worm tested, and treated if necessary.\n\nVet references and a home/family visit are required, and an adoption fee applies.\n\nTransport options are available within our area of operation, including Pennsylvania, the tri-state area, and New England. Please note we do not adopt animals into Canada.\n\nVisit www.pmarinc.org for more information, and to fill out an application.",

Despite this, she has been the sweetest girl that just absolutely loves attention. Her masses were removed and biopsied and we were ecstatic to find out they were benign. We are still working on her ears, but our vet believes she will have chronic ear infections. Maria is housebroken, great on a leash, good with dogs, and would be fine in a home with kids. She will need a home with no small animals. ",

        "description": "Name: Murphy\nBreed: Collie Pyrenees Mix\nAge: 1 year\nDisposition: Working breed\n\nAbout Murphy:\nMurphy is a one-year-old Collie Pyrenees mix who is looking for a home where he can put his working breed instincts to use. He is an active and intelligent dog who thrives on having a job and purpose in life.\n\nPersonality:\nMurphy is a dedicated and hardworking dog with a strong work ethic. He is known for his intelligence and is quick to learn and follow commands. He is an alert and attentive companion who is always ready for a task. While he may be serious and focused during work, he can also be affectionate and loyal to his human companions.\n\nWork and Job Requirements:\nAs a working breed, Murphy requires a home where he can have a job or specific tasks to engage his mind and energy. This could include activities such as herding, agility training, or participating in dog sports. Murphy will excel in an environment where he is given the opportunity to work and use his natural instincts. Regular mental and physical stimulation is essential for his overall well-being.\n\nTraining:\nMurphy is a highly trainable dog due to his intelligence and eagerness to work. He will benefit from consistent and positive reinforcement training methods. With the right guidance and training, he can become a well-behaved and reliable companion. Engaging in activities that challenge his mind and provide structure will help fulfill his working breed needs.\n\nActivity Level:\nMurphy has a high activity level and requires regular exercise to stay happy and content. Daily walks, runs, or engaging in activities that simulate his working instincts will help burn off his excess energy. Providing him with sufficient physical exercise and mental stimulation will contribute to his overall happiness and prevent behavioral issues that may arise from boredom.\n\nIdeal Home:\nMurphy would thrive in a home where his working abilities can be utilized. Owners who have experience with working breeds or have a background in dog training would be well-suited for him. A home with a large securely fenced yard or access to open spaces would be ideal. Murphy needs an owner who understands his needs for mental and physical stimulation and is committed to providing him with a purposeful life.\n\nIf you are looking for a dedicated and active companion who thrives on having a job, Murphy might be the perfect match for you. Prepare to embark on a fulfilling journey with this intelligent and hardworking dog!",

She is only 3 yrs old but has experienced things well beyond her years. She has a bit of separation anxiety so someone who works from home or is retired and home most of the time would be the the best dog parent for her. She is very loving and friendly,  although sometimes it takes her a few minutes to warm up you. She is spayed, utd with her vaccines,  heartworm negative and on monthly preventative. She is good with other dogs but we don't know about cats. She would do best in a home with older children - at least 10, A fenced yard, an approved application and a home visit are required. ",

He needs to be the only dog at this point but he loves cats. He will be a wonderful family dog but right now he is still learning how to behave, so a home without small children would be best. A fenced yard is a requirement. He loves his stuffies, is 99% housetrained, is crate trained, is vaccinated and on monthly heartworm prevention. He needs a family who will be will to continue his obedience training. He LOVES car rides (but a car harness is definitely required) and he does very well out in public places. He loves all people and is very social. He is learning it is not appropriate to jump up. We are working on leash walking with a head halter and he is doing well, just needs continued practice.\nHe knows his name and comes when called,, he knows sit and down, paw, and is working on mastering stay, leave it and off.  He loves to cuddle with you!!

        "description": "Meet Bridgette! \n\nBridgette recently became a tripod, though we suspect the dead leg was an older untreated injury. And unfortunately she ended up with a torn CCL in a back leg while in a foster home. She is currently in a medical foster home in NY where she is recovering from her CCL surgery done on 10/16. \n\nYes, a tripod in the front and CCL injury in the back!! This girl is a survivor. \n\nBridgette will soon be ready for her furever home. We are hoping to find a calm, stress free furever home, probably with someone who is home alot! This precious soul has been through so much and she's pulled through, only to be hit with set back after set back more recently. She had overcome all her obstacles but definitely showed signs of shutting down as her confidence was shaken to the core while in another foster home where she tore a CCL. \n********************* \nSweet Bridgette found herself in a high kill shelter in NC through no fault of their own. A stray, emaciated and with a non-functioning leg, the shelter put her on the euthanasia list, along with another sweet pup Ellie, who had been hit by a car. \n\nThese girls had survived horror and they were still here, yet they found themselves fighting for their lives in the shelter - we could not let them down. Our rescue partnered with a medical rescue group to save these girls from euthanasia and get them to hospital for their treatment and surgeries. \n\nJust check out their 'freedom' ride together the day we got them out of the shelter!! Even with their injuries, tails are wagging and ears flopping, they knew they were free and now in good hands! Bridgette is at a healthy weight, had an amputation, and as you can see from her video, she is a very happy fully functioning tripod! \n\nThe hospital at the time also suspected she also had chronic CCL disease in her knees. \n\nLink to album, showing before and after surgery photos and videos: https://photos.app.goo.gl/dY1wQhJtciJJUUye9 \nWagging tails and happy to accept pupperonis as sympathy gifts! \n\nBridgette is still a young pup, very loving and just look at her stunning coat and ooooooh, those eyes!! If you are interested in loving this precious girl, please contact Aly on 732 604 0625 ASAP!",

He's a great dog with many quirks: Rambo is selective about people. He's not a fan of other dogs, but totally loves cats! Occasionally, DCO Hess brings in Pippin who he adores and he's recently met BeeBee, Pippin's newest cat-sister. \n\nRambo loves the outdoors and is looking for a family that would go on adventures with him. He loves attention, he loves to play ball, and LOVES to chase the water hose. Are you interested in adding this handsome ginger to your life??

        "description": "Mack-aroni! \n\nMack is a 7-1/2 year old shepherd mix. He came to the shelter in September of 2021 as a stray but has received little interest. While Mack initially takes a little cozying up with new people he eventually warms up and loves to show off his toys and give you all of his attention. He has a thyroid issue that makes him a little on the chunky side, but he is now on medication which has helped him lose a lot of his extra weight (and that is just more to love)! He is just a happy, goofy guy who loves to play fetch, and can often be seen carrying around a big stuffed animal! He loves people although due to his size a home without small children is highly recommended. Due to his long stay here a home without other dogs would be best, and we would recommend a feline free home as well. He is microchipped, UTD on vaccines, and neutered.\n\nIf you would like to meet Mack (it may take a few times, but he's worth it!) please fill out the app below!\n\n\nTrue Friends AWC\n16332 SR 706\nMontrose PA 18801\nKennel License # 7284",

        "description": "Name: Murphy\nBreed: Collie Pyrenees Mix\nAge: 1 year\nDisposition: Working breed\n\nAbout Murphy:\nMurphy is a one-year-old Collie Pyrenees mix who is looking for a home where he can put his working breed instincts to use. He is an active and intelligent dog who thrives on having a job and purpose in life.\n\nPersonality:\nMurphy is a dedicated and hardworking dog with a strong work ethic. He is known for his intelligence and is quick to learn and follow commands. He is an alert and attentive companion who is always ready for a task. While he may be serious and focused during work, he can also be affectionate and loyal to his human companions.\n\nWork and Job Requirements:\nAs a working breed, Murphy requires a home where he can have a job or specific tasks to engage his mind and energy. This could include activities such as herding, agility training, or participating in dog sports. Murphy will excel in an environment where he is given the opportunity to work and use his natural instincts. Regular mental and physical stimulation is essential for his overall well-being.\n\nTraining:\nMurphy is a highly trainable dog due to his intelligence and eagerness to work. He will benefit from consistent and positive reinforcement training methods. With the right guidance and training, he can become a well-behaved and reliable companion. Engaging in activities that challenge his mind and provide structure will help fulfill his working breed needs.\n\nActivity Level:\nMurphy has a high activity level and requires regular exercise to stay happy and content. Daily walks, runs, or engaging in activities that simulate his working instincts will help burn off his excess energy. Providing him with sufficient physical exercise and mental stimulation will contribute to his overall happiness and prevent behavioral issues that may arise from boredom.\n\nIdeal Home:\nMurphy would thrive in a home where his working abilities can be utilized. Owners who have experience with working breeds or have a background in dog training would be well-suited for him. A home with a large securely fenced yard or access to open spaces would be ideal. Murphy needs an owner who understands his needs for mental and physical stimulation and is committed to providing him with a purposeful life.\n\nIf you are looking for a dedicated and active companion who thrives on having a job, Murphy might be the perfect match for you. Prepare to embark on a fulfilling journey with this intelligent and hardworking dog!",

After many months, they realized that Tula needed a family of her own. Tula is an amazing dog. She loves people and loves to give hugs. She likes dogs and some cats. She is housebroken and a very smart girl. Although she looks to be black/white in pics, she is really chocolate color like a  miniature choc lab. She would do well in any home situation, whether you are an active family or comfortable sharing the sofa with her while watching your favorite show. She has no problem issues and really wants to get on with her new life.\n\nShe is currently in the Houston area but transportation is available and easy. A portion of her adoption fee will be for transportation.\n\nI would love to talk with you about Tula. Please text me first to let me know you will be calling 281-608-2368.\n\n\n",

        "description": "**WE ARE ALWAYS IN NEED OF FOSTER HOMES** Homeward Bound Dog Rescue is an all volunteer rescue organization and all our dogs and puppies are in foster homes - we are not a shelter and do NOT have a facility where we house our dogs. For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com. You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nThis is Kena. She is a Beagle/Aussie mix around 2 yrs. old and 30 lbs. Kena was surrendered because her owner was moving. She\u2019s very sweet and gets along with the resident dog and cat. She\u2019s fully house trained and is able to be out of the crate overnight with no issues. She would probably love a fenced yard where she can run full speed (she\u2019s fast!) and burn off energy, and then come cuddle up next to you on the couch and snooze. She walks well on the leash, although she tends to bark at/react to other dogs. It seems to be more out of excitement than aggression. This is one behavior she will need to continue to work on. Her foster mom works from home, but she does have some separation anxiety when left alone. She would love a family with someone who is home most of the day, though her anxiety may improve if she has more experience being alone. She hasn\u2019t been destructive at all, so she may not even need to be crated while alone, though her foster has not fully tested this yet! She\u2019s great in the car and happily jumps in to go for a ride. She would love a playful canine sibling to pal around with, though not required. She\u2019s very smart and aims to please. She just needs someone willing to give her the exercise and guidance she needs. She will gladly pay you back with the cutest head tilt and a hundred kisses! Overall, she\u2019s a wonderful dog and full of love to give her new family!\n\nOur adoption clinics are held one Saturday a month at our facility in Schenectady on John Street, located directly behind Boulevard Bowl (Erie Boulevard) from 10 am to 12 pm (directions are on our website).  We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step.  Once your application has been reviewed you will receive an email invitation to attend an adoption event. Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates as we are adopting dogs out in between adoption events. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

I am an intelligent, friendly, affectionate, and playful dog who loves to be around people. I was born with only 3 legs, but it really doesn't affect me much. I still love to play and go for walks and I'm a really fast runner.  I love to snuggle up on the couch and soak up as much affection as I can get. I am a great listener and will always be there for you on your worst days.  If you're looking for a furry friend who will stick by your side through thick and thin, I am the one for you! I can't wait to meet you and start this new chapter in my life.",

Life started out a little ruff \u2013 me and my best bud, Ava, were found all alone at an abandoned house. We then landed at a shelter, but let's just say country livin' wasn't quite the life for energetic pups like us. Especially since space was tight, and you know, the whole \"risk of euthanasia\" thing wasn't ideal. Thankfully, we were then moved over to Saving Grace until a home comes along.\n\nBut hey, that's all in the past! Now I'm on the hunt for my forever home, and let me tell you, it's gotta be full of fun and adventure.  I may be missing a leg (don't worry, it doesn't slow me down one bit!), but my spirit is bigger than life! I may be three-legged, but I have the energy of four!  Walks in the park or just cuddling on the couch - I am down for all!\n\nWhile I adore my pal Ava (who also needs a home), we also enjoy time apart.  I am happy to shower a new family with all the love I've got.  \n\nSo, if you're looking for a vibrant, fun-loving pup who's ready to conquer every walk and cuddle session with enthusiasm, then look no further!  Don't be discouraged by my missing leg \u2013 my heart and spirit are full, and I'm ready to fill your life with endless joy.  Please contact Saving Grace and tell them you want to meet Ella, the three-legged wonder dog, and let's start our forever adventure together!\n\n********************************************************************************************************\n\nWatch these videos of Ella playing (copy and paste into your browser):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/g_BA-p4VrS8\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rIf50FjgiRs\n\nPlease consider adopting a special needs pet.

Her foster family is committed to her fully and prepared to keep her if a better home cannot be found. Mabel is an adolescent female mixed breed (see photos for her DNA results). She is up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative and will soon be spayed. \nThe Good\nMabel has a wonderful temperament and is good with other dogs of all sizes, cats and kids!  She has wirey, long hair that needs routine brushing but isn\u2019t a dog that needs professional grooming every six weeks. She knows some basic manners such as \u201csit\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d and has pretty good leash manners. She is fantastic on car rides and loves outdoor activities such as hiking.\nThe Bad\nDespite her wirey coat, she does shed and is not hypoallergenic. She is a typical adolescent dog that needs work on her impulse control and basic house etiquette. She will counter surf and get into things if given the opportunity. \nThe Ugly\nMabel has some of the worst separation anxiety we have ever seen. She absolutely panics when left alone. She cannot be contained and will jump tall pens, fences and enclosures. She can easily escape out of a traditional folding crate and will attempt to escape out of \u201cescape proof\u201d crates until she is successful or seriously injures herself. She immediately urinates and defecates out of sheer terror when her people leave. SHE CANNOT BE LEFT ALONE. There is a chance she will eventually be able to be left for short periods of time but this is years down the road with continued behavior modification. She is receiving anxiety meds and has made very small improvements in the six weeks she has been with us. We will require she follows up with both a veterinary behavior expert and trainer of our choosing if she is adopted. \n\nWe have had a few people comment that we should make her a service dog so she can go everywhere with her people. She is not a stable enough dog to do service work and trying to pass her off as one is a disservice to actual service dogs. \n\nIf you have read this far and still think Mabel may fit your lifestyle, please visit our website at www.LogansRescue.org to read over our adoption information and fill out an application.

I come with a mix of awesomeness and a charming personality that's sure to steal your heart.\n\nI can be delightfully laid-back, enjoying those calm moments, or I can transform into a bouncing ball of joy when the mood strikes. Walks and jogs? Count me in, especially if you're by my side. But here's the thing-I love playing with other dogs so much that I often choose their company over toys.\n\nLet's talk sunbathing. If your couch has that perfect spot for catching rays, you can bet I'll be there, soaking it all in. I'm a big fan of lounging, whether it's under tables, during dinner time, while you're working at your desk, or even when you're cuddled up in bed. I'm all about being close to my people, and if you choose to adopt me, I'll be all about you!\n\nI'm a sociable girl, getting along well with other dogs and kids (especially with submissive/non-dominant dogs). My crate training and potty training with a doggy door are top-notch. I'm a pro at commands like going to my crate and sitting patiently.\n\nNow, about my diet-here's the deal: I have EPI (Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency), which means my pancreas doesn't produce the enzymes I need to digest food properly. Thanks to some attentive rescuers and veterinary care, we've got it all figured out. I'll need a specific diet and a pancreatic enzyme replacement supplement to keep me feeling great. Think of it as a special appetizer and entree at every meal. EPI won't slow me down, and I'm ready to trade serial kisses for a loving forever home day in and day out. So, how about it?\n\nLocal adoption fee is $200 (in TX)\nOut of state adoption fee is $400 (includes transport to your area - $50 Temporary Fuel \nCharge will be added)",

Jackie is a shy girl who loves her person and all other dogs.  She is a hesitant with new people but with time (and treats!) she comes out of her shell. \n\nJackie would do best in a quiet home without many people coming and going.  She would do best in a home with other dogs as this is how she learns to trust her people.  \n\nJackie is crate trained and house broken. She is up to date on vaccines, spayed, heartworm negative, on monthly heartworm medication, and microchipped.\n\nJackie is about a year old.  \n\nJackie is considered special needs due to her fear / shyness. Given this, we will only place Jackie in a home with another confident dog or a home without another dog but an adopter who has extensive time to spend with her and continue to help her develop and gain confidence. Jackie would not do well in a busy home or a home with younger children.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Jackie, the first step is to complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org.

        "description": "Meet our Dani!  This sweet girl was rescued locally.  Dani is an abuse case and has several injuries, including multiple upper and lower jaw fractures as well as a fracture to one of the bones in her left ear that assists with hearing.  Dani underwent weekly procedures for about 6 months and several surgeries and is now healed.  Unfortunately given the severity of the abuse, Dani will never appear normal but don't tell her that!  \n\nDue to the abuse, Dani suffers from Microcephaly.  Dani also has severe separation anxiety/stress induced anxiety.  We have seen numerous specialists for this and Dani has been on multiple prescription medication but unfortunately none of these have assisted.  We believe that much of this is due to her brain injury.  \n\nDespite all that she has been through, Dani is simply the happiest dog!  She does not know a stranger, 2 legged or 4 legged!  In typical lab fashion, she is an active girl but not overly active!   \n\nDani has earned her CGC, TDI, and CGCA titles.  \n\nDani cannot be crated.  She is about 90% housebroken but will have accidents once she is stressed and she will spin in her accidents.   \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Dani, please complete an application at our website, www.helporphanpuppies.org.  Please note our adoption requirements and feel free to contact us with any questions.  Thank you.\n\nPlease note:  All of our dogs are fostered locally a minimum of 2 weeks.  Adopting a dog that has been fostered locally is a very important consideration. Animals that are fostered locally in private homes allow the fosters to learn more about the dogs personality and allows for making the best match possible.  Also, animals that are transported into our area and placed directly often carry diseases, including parvo and distemper.  Animals can also become ill on transports to the northeast, as they are exposed to other animals in route.  If you have any questions regarding these diseases and the risks of not adopting locally, please contact your vet.  \n\nAlso consider any group that does not require a home visit.  If they are not conducting a home visit consider if they are vested in where their animals go.  As an organization, we invest a significant amount of time into all of our dogs, including crate training, house breaking, obedience training, and determining each dog's personality to consider making the best match possible.\n\nHelp Orphan Puppies is registered with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Our Rescue Registration Number is RR047.\n\nPlease note that Petfinder requires us to identify a breed/breeds.  We do our best to determine a puppy's breed but without both parents present, we are unable to guarantee a puppy's breed.",

        "description": "Min Pin,\nmale,\n8 years,\n17 lbs.\nPirate is a very endearing dog. Just do not call him cute, he has the spirit of a Doberman packed into a Min Pin body and wants you to respect his authority. His life work is to keep his home safe. Pirate loves to let you know when someone rings the doorbell, even if the doorbell is on the TV, and even if he is not always the first dog to notice, he is always the most enthusiastic. Pirate enjoys quick patrols of the yard to see what has changed, and do some sniffing, then it is back in the house to see if the food dishes got magically refilled while he was out, and then do some serious napping. Pirate loves a routine, and he loves his bed. He will sometimes join you on the couch and nestle near you. He is not a big snuggler but he does like gentle scratches on his chin and ear rubs, as long as he is in the mood. At night he prefers sleeping on the couch and keeping the house safe while you sleep. Pirate is a unique dog with some unique behaviors. He had a stroke when he was younger which left him with some ataxia and vision differences, along with sensory issues, and some anxiety. Touch can be overwhelming, new surfaces take some figuring out, and a lot of sound or activity will really overwhelm him. He does not like being jostled or bumped into, and being picked up is too much for him, we do not suggest it. This means you have to make some accommodations, like transporting him in his carrier, and letting him decide when it is time for affection. Pirate cannot do stairs but can navigate ramps and can jump on the couch like a pro as long as he has solid footing. Pirate does not do well on walks because you can never be sure when he will be overloaded by his environment, so a fenced yard is necessary. Pirate can handle a quiet visitor or two, as long as they respect his rules and boundaries, and he will quickly make friends with people who know that you should ask before you pet, especially if you bring treats. Pirate is house trained but he tends to go on a schedule, and if he needs to go he needs to go. He does his best to use the pee pad if no one is around to let him out but no one is perfect. Pirate lives with other dogs and cats, and is always polite but not looking to play or really interact with them. He likes to be left out of their games, although he is a champion at the Kong Wobbler.\n\n*************************************************************************\n \nDue to Massachusetts State Regulations we are unable to adopt to residents of Massachusetts at this time.

        "description": "URGENT - Need Adopter ASAP! \n\nMeet Uncle Jesse! \n\nThis stunningly handsome German Shepherd found himself in an overcrowded shelter in TX, through no fault of his own.  \n\nUncle Jesse is a senior boy, who should never have been dumped at all, let alone for being older.  And he only has one eye, why do you need two anyway?!!  \n\nWho wants an old guy with one seeing eye, right?!!  So of course, he was put on the euthanasia list ........ \nWe could not let that happen to him.  Our rescue saved this senior boy minutes from being euthanised in order to free up kennel space. \n\nHe is in a loving foster home just now but it's a busy house, with too many people, kids, dogs etc, he isn't getting the peace, quiet, and attention he really needs.\n\nThis precious guy just needs to live in a warm, loving home, with grass to romp around in from time to time, to feel the sun on his face and watch all nature around him.\n\nAnd of course, in true GSD style, to be with his people.  \n\nUncle Jesse is fine with other dogs but we feel at this time in his life, he deserves to have all the attention in a home.  Unless there's another older quiet pup whom he could snuggle with if he so desires.\n\nIf you are interested in loving this precious boy or the rest of his days, please contact Anne-Marie on 919 608 9314 ASAP.\n\nCB",

        "description": "Here is Bodine\u2019s bio for cross posting\n\nHowl-dy-ho folks! Bodacious Bodine here letting you know I am officially looking for my own home, sweet, home.\n\nJust over a year ago, I was found hiding, sick with infections, loaded with parasites and autoimmune issues. My handsome face was raw, as were my feet, elbows and back end. Everyone thought my days were numbered, but that didn\u2019t matter to The Animal Support Project. Even while I was in pain, they could tell I was a loving boy with a strong will to live, and they were determined to give me the best days they could before I moved on to the happy hunting ground in the sky. But yeehaw! Instead we discovered the root cause of my health problems was just allergies, and they are now under control. I hear modesty is an affliction some dogs suffer from, but not this joyful, gregarious \u201clife-is-a-party\u201d hound. Can you believe how great I look now? Those days are just a distant memory because I am doing fantastic - living large and lovin\u2019 life!\n\nI am a sincere, intelligent, eager-to-please kind of guy, but like all pups I blossom with a kind but firm, consistent human partner. I can show you how hard a dog will try to learn and do his best with positive reenforcement. In fact, as proof, I recently passed my Canine Good Citizen exam!\n\nI have been told I have an endearing personality, and continuously win people over with my charm! I do adore attention and don\u2019t always grasp the concept of personal space, but a gentle reminder, maybe with a bonus butt scratch, brings me right back to being a gentleman. I am definitely not a subdued city boy and need a country home where I promise to excel at fenced perimeter patrol. I am a scent hound so will be happy to alert, chase and tree any marauding varmints. If you stroll over to take a look and tell me what a \u201cgood job\u201d I\u2019ve done protecting my homestead, I will be so proud to have completed my mission, I will just want to hang out with you again.\n\nPack breeds like me are very social. I do not enjoy being separated from the rest of the household. I love all people, whether friend or stranger. I am young and still excitable though, and can occasionally be jumpy or mouthy, so I need a home with older children. I also am an exuberant player so would do best with another uninhibited dog, although I have done well adapting my play style to suit the smaller, older dogs in my foster home. I do not do well in a crate but I do respect gates and am also fine being left loose in the house. I will just enjoy a well-deserved siesta loyally waiting until my family comes back home.\n\nI am quite a speedy fellow and can run like the wind if tempted by the right scent. I also am not road savvy because my head is usually down - due to my nose insisting on some serious ground sniffing. Therefore, I require a 4-6 foot sturdy fence because like most hounds, I also have wanderlust. That could be how I got lost in the first place and I never want to be that sore and sick again.\n\nDo you savor in nature's glory like me? Like long walks or hikes? Like to play outside or snuggle on the couch? Do you have allergies or know someone who does and understand their significance? Want to love this good, ol\u2019 hound boy forever? Contact The Animal Support Project to see if we would be a good match. http://www.theanimalsupportproject.com/contact-forms/ Thanks for listening y\u2019all!",

Simple surgery that the rescue pays for.\n\nBubbles is a compact snuggle bug who loves attention. Her history is unknown, as she was found tied to a tree in a park in NYC. Bubbles then found herself on the euthanasia list, and became my foster. She will \u201csmile\u201d and wiggle when she is happy. Bubbles loves a warm bath and a peanut butter filled kong. Bubbles loves to wander around her fenced in yard, however, she does well on a leash as well. \n\nBubbles knows the command \u201csit\u201d, and is currently working on \u201cdown\u201d, \u201cshake\u201d, and heeling. Bubbles loves all snackies including Dunkin munchkins. Bubbles loves to ride in the car. Bubbles does well in a crate, however, she may tear blankets up. \n\nWhile Bubbles has never had an issue with any people she has met, Bubbles does not appear to be a fan of other dogs.\n",

He rarely barks and is house & crate trained, displaying good behavior both indoors and outdoors. He stops 2 feet from his crate and will sit and wait for his person to pet, kiss, hug him, and then he goes in his crate while he waits for his goodie! Such a sweetheart and loves his people! He sleeps peacefully in his crate at night and travels well in the car. Lobo does well with other dogs of different sizes and is very friendly with people! \n\nWith a moderate activity level, Lobo enjoys walks of varying lengths. A fenced yard or active lifestyle is ideal for Lobo and he is not trained to be off-leash. Lobo responds to basic commands like sit, stay, come, heel (for leash walking), and off (for not jumping on people). Lobo is ready for a loving home to cherish and support him throughout his life. Could you give him a lifetime of love?\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***LOBO IS IN NORTH TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE. Read below for more information.\n\nOur dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. The adoption contract and fee are finalized prior to transport. As a Pep's Pals Rescue direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). \n\nOur adoption fee is $275 plus health certificate and transport (varies by location). This adoption fee includes all current vaccinations, deworming, microchip (additional $12.99 registration fee required at time of adoption), fecal analysis, spay/neuter, and a heartworm test if over 6 months old. All dogs are current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention. A health exam will be completed and a health certificate issued by a veterinarian within 10 days of transport.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the adoption application below:\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/57837/generic",

        "description": "Meet Zeke, a 3-year-old, 60 pound bundle of affection who will capture your heart. His joy comes from being close to his human, displaying both exuberant and cuddly moments. Zeke is house and crate trained, responsive to commands like sit & down, and a quick learner eager for treats. While well-behaved, he tends to jump when overly excited and requires ongoing guidance for manners. His favorite place is the couch with his head in your lap, all he wants is to be near his humans!\u00a0\n\nZeke gets along with other dogs and people, and we are unsure of how he does with cats. While likely good with kids, a home with kids over 10 is advised due to his size, as he enjoys running and jumping, potentially knocking over small children.\u00a0He loves eating from his big Kong slow feeder bowl. We have worked on his manners and he is going great, but needs reminders.\u00a0He is\u00a0very smart, loves his kennel,\u00a0toys, and treats.\u00a0He is not food aggressive with his food toward humans or other dogs.\n\nThis playful pup loves chew toys. Harvey sleeps in his kennel at night and when home alone to prevent mischief. Enthusiastic about car rides, he remains curious and adventurous. He even enjoys days at doggy daycare! Rescued from a high-kill shelter in East Texas after his owner died & he was living on a chain 24/7, Zeke has transformed into a confident, happy, and sweet companion. An active household with another dog for him to play with, ideally a fenced yard, and perhaps someone to accompany him on runs, walks, and hikes would be amazing for Zeke. Apartment living would not suit his energetic nature. Zeke is ready for his furever home!\u00a0\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***MOST OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE. Read below for more information.\n\nOur dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. The adoption contract and fee are finalized prior to transport. As a Pep's Pals Rescue direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).\u00a0\n\nOur adoption fee is $350 plus health certificate and transport (varies by location). This fee includes all current vaccinations, deworming, microchip (additional $12.99 registration fee required at time of adoption), fecal analysis, spay/neuter for dogs 6 months & older, and a heartworm test if over 6 months old. All dogs are current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention (he did test heartworm positive, but is almost done with his slow kill treatment for heartworms covered by the rescue & doesn\u2019t require activity restriction - not contagious either & he will need to be retested in June). A health exam will be completed and a health certificate issued by a veterinarian within 10 days of transport.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the adoption application below:\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/57837/generic",

        "description": "Meet Presley, an approximately 3-year-old companion who epitomizes the term \"Velcro dog.\" Presley is in search of a warm and caring forever home where she can relish in moments of play, affectionate cuddles with her human or furry siblings, and rest easy without the fear of ever being let go, a fate she once experienced with her previous family.\n\nPresley is a devotee of quality time with her human companions, and she adores her walks, exhibiting excellent behavior on the leash with people and not pulling much. She is house and crate trained, and knows the commands \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\"\n\nIn her foster home, she is cat friendly and displays a friendly attitude towards other dogs, even plays with the other dogs\u00a0in the yard!\u00a0She is not good with chickens, but she is good with tortoises lol! She is dominant, so her ideal future home would be with submissive dogs, as she thrives in an environment where she can take on the alpha role without conflict. Slow, proper introductions to other dogs and cats are crucial! She does constantly yearn to be by her human's side, but she has grown to truly enjoy being a part of the pack in her foster home and would do so in her forever home as well. While on a leash, Presley exhibits reactivity towards other dogs and animals; however, she responds well to redirection and can be easily guided.\n\nWe rescued Presley from a high-risk shelter in Texas just in the nick of time. She was on the brink of being euthanized due to space constraints, especially being the shelter's longest-standing resident. Her previous owners were contacted, but they showed no interest in reclaiming her or her Husky friend.\n\nPresley's tale is one of resilience and unwavering loyalty. She longs for her forever family, a loving home where she can be cherished unconditionally. Is there anyone out there willing to provide Presley with the love and care she so rightfully deserves?\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***PRESLEY IS FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE. Read below for more information.\n\nOur dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. The adoption contract and fee are finalized prior to transport. As a Pep's Pals Rescue direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).\n\nOur adoption fee is $350 plus health certificate and transport (varies by location). This fee includes all current vaccinations, deworming, microchip (additional $12.99 registration fee required at time of adoption), fecal analysis, spay/neuter for dogs 6 months & older, and a heartworm test if over 6 months old. All dogs are current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention (she was heartworm positive, but has completed treatment and has since tested negative). A health exam will be completed and a health certificate issued by a veterinarian within 10 days of transport.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the adoption application below:\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/57837/generic",

        "description": "Introducing Zara, a delightful one-year-old bundle of affection and unwavering devotion. Zara's journey began when we saved her from a high-kill shelter in Texas, narrowly escaping a grim fate. It's evident that someone may have treated her unkindly, as she initially displays timidity (cowers) around unfamiliar people, but she will also get on her back for belly rubs. With time, love, and a reassuring touch, Zara will blossom into the best version of herself. She has the prettiest coat and if you brush it the opposite way, you can see that her roots are red!\u00a0\n\nIn her nurturing foster home, Zara is flourishing, thanks to her work-at-home foster parents who provide ample human interaction and the attention she craves. She's a snuggling pro, always seeking reassurance and showering you with boundless love. While Zara prefers not to be confined in a kennel at any time, she is house trained and we think she will get used to a crate with some patience & positive reinforcement. She is very food motivated and eager to please. She's very well-mannered on leash and loves walks so much.. Those are\u00a0her favorite! She dislikes being alone, so ideally her family will spend a lot of time at home or bring her places.\n\nZara would thrive in a home with submissive dogs or as the only dog, and slow introductions are crucial when meeting new dogs & settling into a new environment. She is NOT good with cats or other small animals due to her high prey drive, so her future home must not have any. It's important to note that she's best suited for a home with children over the age of 10 as she doesn't always realize her size. She will playfully nibble on you when she wants someone to pet her, which is a typical cattle dog trait.\u00a0\n\nZara needs to be in an environment where those around her understand and respect her boundaries as she continues to heal and learns to trust that she'll never experience harm again. When Zara knows and trusts you, she'll eagerly leap onto you, expressing her love through her endearing, expressive eyes and a hug.\n\nZara delights in a balanced blend of indoor and outdoor play and finds pure joy in basking in the warm sun. If you're in search of an affectionate and loyal companion perfectly suited to a work-from-home /retirement lifestyle or an active one where you\u2019ll bring your dog with you all over, Zara is the ideal addition to your life.\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***MOST OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE.

        "description": "Meet Ringo, the 1 year old Great Dane mix with a unique personality. He was found playing with kids at a school in Texas, but wound up on the euthanasia list for space at the local tiny high kill shelter that is chronically over capacity. He's mastered house training, but doesn't signal when he needs to go out, preferring a set routine. While he's getting used to crate training and enjoys relaxing in it during the day, he'd rather not be crated at night (needs it though).\n\nRingo isn't destructive as long as he's entertained and crated when alone. He alerts his people by barking when people come by, but he doesn\u2019t bark much. He\u2019s a good fit for households with other big dogs (or none) and older children as he doesn\u2019t realize his size and can knock smaller kids over by accident. He truly does love kids and would love to be a part of a family with some. His energy level makes him an excellent companion for running, hiking, and long walks.\n\nIn terms of training, Ringo knows basic commands like Sit, Stay, No, and Release (when he\u2019s allowed to start eating his food), & he is very food motivated. He's a very curious boy and needs mental stimulation, while preferring to be included rather than left alone.\n\nHe\u2019s not a fan of cuddling yet (he may have never known that life)! He loves rubbing his head against people he likes. Sometimes when he gives you a head rub, his shoulder follows along with his back and it turns into a whole body rub from Ringo. While he doesn't require another dog at home, he does need a fenced yard as he enjoys wandering. Overall, Ringo thrives with human companionship and an active lifestyle.\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***MOST OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE.

        "description": "Tex, approximately 1 year old and 45-50 pounds, is a people-friendly pup who enjoys the company of kids, even as young as 9. He plays harmoniously with dogs of various ages and sizes, ranging from 1 to 11 years old and 30 to 125 pounds. While not particularly interested in the barn cat, his compatibility with household cats is uncertain. Accustomed to cattle and horses, he generally ignores them.\n\nOvernight, he comfortably sleeps in his crate, displaying affection for it. Together with his brother, Ranger, they relish porch swing evenings, engaging in activities like chasing balls and wrestling. Tex understands basic commands but requires some leash and recall training, typical of a puppy. He is pretty motivated by treats, and he's a resilient survivor, rescued in Texas after being abandoned. Ideally, he and his brother find a home together, but separate adoptions are also possible. He\u2019s anxiously awaiting transport from Texas to his furever or foster home up north! \n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***MOST OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE.

        "description": "Ranger, approximately 1 year old and 45 pounds, is a people-friendly pup who enjoys the company of kids, even as young as 9. He plays harmoniously with dogs of various ages and sizes, ranging from 1 to 11 years old and 30 to 125 pounds. While not particularly interested in the barn cat, his compatibility with household cats is uncertain. Accustomed to cattle and horses, he generally ignores them.\n\nOvernight, he comfortably sleeps in his crate, displaying affection for it. Together with his brother, they relish porch swing evenings, engaging in activities like chasing balls and wrestling. Ranger understands basic commands but requires some leash and recall training, typical of a puppy. His strong hound instincts make him motivated by treats, and he's a resilient survivor, rescued in Texas after being abandoned. Ideally, he and his brother find a home together, but separate adoptions are also possible. He\u2019s anxiously awaiting transport from Texas to his furever or foster home up north! \n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***MOST OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE.

As a Pep's Pals Rescue direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). \n\nOur adoption fee is $350 plus health certificate and transport (varies by location).

To avoid a high-kill shelter, a Texas foster stepped in as we seek his forever home. He is SO sweet, he just wants to cuddle with his people and give kisses! He is perfectly happy as long as he's next to his humans! \n\nPoe is both house and crate trained, though he pulls a bit on the leash due to his eagerness to explore (easy to fix). He's fantastic with dogs (even cuddles with them in the same dog bed), curious about cats, and adaptable as a single pet or with dog siblings. While good with children, we suggest kids ages 10 or older due to his playful nature and tendency to jump on you out of excitement. Poe is an active, sweet boy who adores bones, snuggling, and knows the command \"sit.\" Plus, he's not bothered by a rumba vacuum\u2014quite the lively and lovable companion! \n\nI mean... do you see that SMILE?

Despite some nervousness around vehicles and other animals during walks, she loves people, often crawling over to you and rolling over to reveal her belly. Piper is in the process of learning fetch, enjoys playing with other dogs, and doesn\u2019t pay any mind to cats. We require Piper\u2019s future home to have another dog as she learns from them and they help boost her confidence since she is shy at first. Adopter must have a fenced yard as well. She\u2019s a bit more cautious around the cows at her foster home, lol!\n\nShe\u2019s a bundle of fun energy, yet she equally enjoys climbing onto the couch to snuggle and watch TV with the family in the evenings. Piper is both kennel and potty trained and very smart with a desire to please! Her positive interactions with seven kids in her foster home ranging from ages 6 to 17 along with all of their friends without problems further highlight her suitability for family life. She\u2019s an amazing addition to any home!!\n\nPiper was rescued from a high kill shelter in rural north Texas along with her 2 sisters after their other 3 littermates were tragically euthanized for space the week before. She is so deserving of her forever home and we know her siblings that have passed will be so happy for her once she finds it!\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***MOST OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE.

She can read the room really well and be calm when she needs to be calm and cuddly, or can be very playful, do zoomies around the yard and romp around with a fur pal, when it's time to play. \n\nMartini has never been upset a day in her life - she is such a happy go lucky girl who makes everyone fall in love with her the second that they meet her.\n\nShe was at the shelter for 30 days before we saved her and she was always a volunteer and staff favorite.\n\nHer foster mama absolutely adores her and came to her at a tough time. She says Martini is exactly what she needed to get through. She is a true joy to have around and brings love and light everywhere she goes.\n\nMartini is:\n1 year old\n35lbs\nFriendly, cuddly, silly, playful\nVery dog friendly\nKid friendly\nWonderful in her crate\nGood on leash\n\nAdopt Martini if you want to love, be loved, and laugh, every single day that you are with her. \n\n*Please note:\nOur dogs are fostered and vetted in Houston before going on transport. If we don't have an adoption lined up in one of our transport cities within 4 weeks of rescue, we transport to our team in Vermont, where our dogs have a higher chance of finding their perfect forever home. Once you fill out an adoption application, it will be screened by our team. From there, if your application is a good fit, our team will arrange a call and schedule a meet and greet or we will arrange transport.",

        "description": "Col. Potter Cairn Terrier Rescue\nwww.cairnrescue.comMeet Ruffian. He is a very friendly, happy, loving, cuddly boy. He loves to chew so he needs lots of chewy toys. He sleeps in bed with his person and loves to curl up right behind your knees. He wants to be with his person as much as possible but when you go out if he gets a treat or a chewy with a little peanut butter, he will be happy. He will sometimes even go in his crate on his own. He loves to go for walks, but likes to pull on leash. He is dog friendly when around resident dogs, but gets overly excited when he sees another dog while on leash. He needs to be trained and needs someone who is willing to spend time and effort to train him. He is currently wearing a belly band; he keeps it dry at night and when crated. I feel this sweet loveable boy will make someone a wonderful pet if they are willing to take the time needed for training. In other words, ruffian has great potential.FOR LOTS MORE INFORMATION ON RUFFIAN ENTER OR COPY THIS LINK ONTO YOUR WEB BROWSER:https://www.cairnrescue.com/store/dogs/\nRuffian is being fostered in Danvers, MA in a PRIVATE FOSTER HOME but we allow our dogs to be adopted out all over the United States and Canada!LEARN OUR 'ADOPTION FAQS': Any questions that you may have about our adoption process, fees, transporting a dog, and our policy not to adopt to families with small children, can be answered at our main website or going directly to this link:\nhttps://www.cairnrescue.com/service/faq/\nIT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU READ THE FAQ'S BEFORE COMPLETING AN APPLICATION.

She has travelled to upstate New York to find her forever home! She is estimated to be between four and five years old. She is a very calm dog. Natalia walks well on a leash. She is sociable meeting new people and needs to be introduced to other dogs slowly. Natalia would do very well in a home without other dogs but does tolerate sharing the attention. Natalia currently plays well with all other dogs at the rescue but loves one on one attention. She does well with a bath and rides well in a car. Natalia is a very quiet dog and listens to basic commands. Please consider giving her a forever home!\nUpdate 6/27/2024; Natalia still waits patiently for her forever home, she is so kind to everyone she meets. Natalia has been waiting since March 2024, Please consider adopting Miss Natalia as she would make an excellent companion.\nUpdate 7/23/2024; Natalia still awaits her forever home. Please consider adopting Miss Natalia, she is truly a sweet girl!",

        "description": "Pepper has vision. He would prefer to be the only dog. Loves people and cuddling, velcro and will follow you everywhere.\n\nMeet Pepper!\n\nPepper was surrendered to a shelter at 13 years old. His history prior to that is unknown. He was saved from the shelter by a local organization who also started his vetting, and he came to us about two weeks later. In spite of all this, Pepper is quite a character! He has a lot of personality, definitely knows what he wants and doesn't want, and will let you know.\n\nAnd what he wants is this ...\n\nPepper feels he has one very important job, and more than anything, he wants to do his job well. That job is to be. with. you. No matter where you are, day or night, Pepper wants to be with you, and he will love you with everything he has in his little 8 pound body. If he is not with you, he will not hesitate to let you know how upset he is. He's a great cuddler and would spend the entire day cuddling in my lap if he could. He would love to keep you warm on those cool fall and winter days!\n\nShortly after arriving at his foster home, Pepper had an urgent dental (20 teeth were extracted, he has six bottom teeth remaining and will need to eat soft food for the rest of his life), was neutered, saw the ophthalmologist (he has nuclear sclerosis in both eyes and a healed corneal ulcer in his right eye), and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), for which he takes Levothyroxine twice a day. He will need to have regular blood work to monitor his thyroid. Two lumps removed from his forehead were apocrine gland cysts and completely benign. He is nicely managed on pain medication and a joint supplement for arthritis and bilateral luxating patellas, and even runs everywhere! He's also attempted, with some success, to climb over baby gates. Pepper goes through phases where he drinks and urinates quite a bit more than usual, but testing so far has not shown a cause. Housebreaking continues to be a slow work in progress and he is unable to go through the night without urinating.\n\nPepper is fine with the other three dogs in his foster home, but is jealous and upset if he is not getting all of the attention. The other three dogs here are timid and small like he is, and if one is where Pepper wants to be, he will just lay down on top of that dog.\n\nPepper would prefer a home where someone is home most of the time and where he could be your only dog, or with only one other quiet small dog. Due to his size, a home without young children is recommended, and he will also require an understanding owner who is able to carefully monitor any changes in his appetite, behavior, or pottying.\n\nPepper reminds me of a used car. He's a bit banged up, scratched, and is missing paint in some areas, but with lots of love and good maintenance, he'll keep going and going and going! :)\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

        "description": "Mona Lisa has a sad past, but her smile still shines through.  \n\nShe was picked up as a stray along the Texas / Mexico border where she was found defeated and laying in the grass.  She was brought into the shelter system only to be just another sad pittie, lost in the mix.   It took a special person who shared her story which allowed us to rescue her. \n\nFast forward, Mona Lisa is adoption ready.   She is a petite pittie, around 45lbs, 4 years old and extremely affectionate and gentle.  Mona Lisa was temporarily fostered by a family who had small children and she was very gentle with them;  after all pit bulls are known to be \"the nanny dog\".  They have the reputation for being a guardian angel of children. \n\nMona Lisa is healthy, up to date on vaccines, walks well on leash, has good manners in the home - housebroken, crate trained and does not chew - and loves to cuddle and give kisses.   \n\nAs soft and affectionate she is with people, Mona Lisa does not enjoy the company of other dogs and we have no been able to cat test her.  We recommend she be your one and only pet.  She has enough love to go around! \n\nShe would benefit from a home with a yard to run, play and enjoy the sunshine!   \n\nIf you are interested in giving Mona Lisa her second chance at an amazing life, please complete an adoption application on our website: www.RTHRS.com",

Chase was adopted out to an older couple a few months ago who fell in love with him and now that he has gotten comfortable with them they have decided he is too strong for them and due to medical issues cannot handle him.\n\nChase is about 1 1/2 years old, Male, Neutered, UTD, and about 50-55 lbs.  He had to have one of his eyes removed due to being scratched by a cat and it got infected but that doesn't stop this sweet boy or impair him in any way.  Chase is loving , sweet, affectionate, and playful.  And albeit he is fine with kids because he is still young and has a lot of energy we would recommend kids over 12.  Also, because he is a hound mix he has a high prey drive so no cats and if you have another dog we are recommending a dog of the same size or larger since he doesn't know his own strength and a meet and greet would be required.  \n\nPoor Chase deserves a chance at a real home and real love and someone who will not give up on him because he is young and energetic.  To give this sweet boy the forever home he longs for please go to our site at www.rthrs.com to complete an application.\n\nChase is currently in Oswego, NY and is available in NY/NJ/PA.",

        "description": "It takes a special kind of person to adopt 2 rescued pups at once. 2 dogs who've been shuffled around in homes, shelters and boarding all because they became inconvenient.\nIt takes a big heart to see past their age and unknown circumstances or breeds and to say yes to giving them a home because they need one and they deserve one.\nCaesar and Pierce are a bonded pair. We don't know why, we don't know how, but we know that when one has to go to a vet visit, the other waits for their return home. We know that Pierce can be away from Caesar for an hour but when he gets home, he greets him like he's been away for weeks. \nThere's no reason to separate these 2, to do so wouldn't be fair for all the unfairness they've already lived.\nCaesar is a 9-year-old, old man. He loves sunbathing and scratches. He'll weave in and out of your legs with his big ol' 67lb frame like a cat trying to get pets at all angles. He's definitely a Pittie mix and he loves his people and his dogs. He is a surrogate big brother to 27lb Pierce who compliments his big buddy so well with his playful energy and love of all toys -squeaky or not. \n2-year-old Pierce looks to Caesar for a boost of confidence. He's on the shyer side of the 2 and although he loves his people, he appreciates a slow introduction so he can take time to sniff and process. Pierce is a Heinz 57 and as much as we'd like to guess his breeds, we'd be lying to you if we did. \nCaesar is described as confident, obedient, sensitive and kind. He loves his car rides and naps on the couch. He's king of chill and doesn't let much ruffle his feathers other than cats.... for this reason, we look forward to a feline-free zone where both of these boys can live out their days without a care in the world and the security of knowing that this is forever.\nBoth of these boys will fill your home with love, loyalty and warmth. They sleep soundly (together) in their crates at night and appreciate a game of fetch in the grass or a leashed walk.\n\nPierce and Caesar are currently living in San Antonio but are available to adopt to the Northeast. For more information about these 2 and to speak with their foster, please fill out an application here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlci8BVgANrWAlqe9wb2WjsDzcQyK0Jag0Sb-ZFSmFtWMy8A/viewform",

I was then adopted a year ago, but sadly my mom is moving unexpectedly and I cannot go with her.  This is what she has to say about me.\n\nHe is a sweet and goofy boy, whose idea of a perfect day is one where he can patrol the backyard, get pet, brushed, and take a long nap. True to the nature of his breed, he likes to protect his people on walks from trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, and other dogs when he\u2019s on the leash. When off leash he does well with other dogs, though he\u2019s more often interested in observing than interacting. \n\nHe adores meeting new people (more people equals more pets) and although he tolerates children, they tend to be too energetic for him so he prefers to avoid them. \n\nWhile not particularly food-motivated, he still loves treats, peanut butter, and cheese. Though laid back and napping for 95% of the day, he can get riled up when he notices something to bark at, and if he\u2019s let out into the yard, tries to avoid coming inside by running around and trying to play with you. He thinks it is a fun game!  He would do best in a calmer home where he gets all of the attention as the only pet to get all your love!\n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation. \n\n*Please apply here: http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2\n\n*Please email to set up an appointment DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or (315) 728-9344 or www.DGIPaws.org or www.DogGoneInn.com\n\nDon't forget to like and follow us on Facebook, we get new animals in regularly.\n\nThank you for choosing rescue! \n",

Nothing makes her happier than being told she is a good girl!  She is getting better on a leash, but does get excited when she sees a squirrel or other dogs. She is excellent with kids but does need to be in a home where she is the one and only pet. She listens very well when asked to do things as she only wants to please her humans.

She loves everyone she meets and greet them with her puppy energy and tail wagging. She is so smart and eager to please. She knows sit, paw, spin and down! \nShe hasn\u2019t shown any food aggression and is gentle at taking treats and is VERY food motivated. she does ok on leash, she pulls here and there but with consistency and training she is getting better each day!

It is possible that a \"backyard breeder\" was discarding the \"not quite perfect\" puppies that they were unable to sell.  We couldn't leave them there, so they were saved in early July.   The day after they arrived at the foster home, she figured out that Tulip is deaf.\n\nTulip is a Gorgeous puppy.  She is white with black / blue merle markings and just a tiny bit of brown on one hind leg.  She has two striking BLUE eyes.  Unfortunately, due to her genetics, she was born deaf.  She is great with other dogs!  She is friendly with everyone she meets!\n\nTulip is very Smart and loves to explore and investigate everything!  She has already learned to \u201csit\u201d for treats and is learning not to jump on her kennel gate when it is time to go out.  She is kennel / house trained.  She walks good on leash.  Tulip also really likes water and has been known to lie down in her water dish, but she isn't a fan of playing in water coming out of a hose.\n\nTulip is very Affectionate and also does a good job of checking in with her person frequently.  She will be an awesome, Loving family member!\n\nTulip is 27 pounds, 5 months old and is a Catahoula mix.  We estimate her adult weight at 50 pounds.  She is spayed, microchipped and up to date on her puppy vaccines.   She is ready to find her forever home!

I was very hungry and thirsty and very scared.  I am now in my foster home, vetted and ready to have a new family with a cozy, fluffy bed and toys and most of all lots of love.  Belly rubs and cuddling are required!!\n\nIndy Anna is a very SMART girl, RIDES like a pro and loves to be NEAR and TOUCH her human and who can resist those CUTE stand-up ears!  She is crate and house trained and does well on leash.  Indy Anna BONDS very quickly, can sit and loves to give KISSES and rest her head on your lap while watching tv.  A nap in the recliner with you is the best.  Indy Anna can jump straight up onto desk height and will sit and watch you while you are working.  Indy Anna is fine with other dogs and would like a home with quieter surroundings and less traffic.  She is super excited to see you when you come home and is not destructive while alone.   Indy Anna will bark if someone knocks on your door but other than that is a pretty QUIET LAID-BACK girl.\n\nIndy Anna is a LOYAL, LOVING girl and will be BFF forever.  She is very DEVOTED to her human and will be wherever you are.  Indy Anna is a great size and is a \"hang out\" and \"lets go riding\" kind of girl.  She has also been seen in the puppy pool so she would most likely loving riding on a boat or being at the beach.  Indy Anna would love to take strolls and then come home to a movie night and when out camping would CUDDLE to keep you and her warm.  If you feel like you can give Indy Anna a forever, loving home please contact Freedom Street Rescue.\n\nFor questions email pattystavinoha@yahoo.com.

I am a SWEET, little boy and my foster mom feels I will not get much bigger or even may remain the same weight.  I am pretty much a HAPPY GO LUCKY guy and I LOVE BEING WITH PEOPLE and also other DOGS.  I have no idea why my previous family just left me and took off.  Oh well, things always work out for the best as I am safe, fed and loved by my foster family and all the other pups that live there.\n\nLoki is a great, loving little boy!  He's EASY GOING, loves toys and sitting by his fosters making sure of always TOUCHING.  The video shows how great Loki is at sitting and he's up for learning a lot more commands and fun things too.  Loki is crate and house trained, loves playing with dogs his size or smaller.  He's curious about cats.  His foster mom says he's not malicious just wants to play and leash walking is progressing.\n\nLoki is so ready to go to his new home and get lots of attention and love.  He would love kiddos to run and play with and other dogs and to be truly involved with his family whether on vacation, road trips or cuddling or just whatever they so desire.  He's a great size pup and Happy Go Lucky best describes his cute little personality.  If you feel like you can provide Loki with a forever, loving home please contact Freedom Street Rescue.\n\nFor questions email pattystavinoha@yahoo.com.

        "description": "Male\n7 months (12/15/2023)\nBorder Collie Mix\n30 lbs (expected 40-50)\nNeutered/Microchipped\nCurrent on Shots\n\nHello everybody, my name is Jet and a young dog loving, college student saw me, and 6 other puppies dumped in a park in the city, and he just knew in his heart that he could not leave us all there.  He quickly took action and called his mom to ask if he could bring us home.  WOW imagine what mom is thinking!!!  Well, she is a compassionate woman as well and said to bring them ALL home.  Some of the pups have found homes and I am looking for mine.  I am safe, fed and loved and pretty much have everything I need-----well except for ONE thing!  I need my new family to love me.  Please help me find a family to care for me forever and not dump me in a busy park and then jet away!!!  (Don't mind the pun!!)\n\nJet is an EXCELLENT boy with a GREAT TEMPERMENT.  He's young and very TRAINABLE as to whatever his new family desires in their home.  One of his favorite things is just running and PLAYING in the back yard with all the other dogs in his foster home.  Of course, sticks. balls and toys are always lots of fun.  Jet is crate trained and doing very well with potty training.  He's just basically a happy, content boy and isn't asking for much other than love, and to be with his family.  He is just a HAPPY GO LUCKY pup who will make you LAUGH.  After a very busy day he loves to SNUGGLE and watch TV.  Jet loves to be with humans of all ages.  He's learning about leash walking and progressing with all the other things that are needed in a puppy's life.  \n\nJet is young and will ADAPT to any lifestyle easily.  He has ALL QUALITIES IN ONE PUP-he loves to play and have fun and then come inside and snuggle and relax.  Jet would be a great OUTDOOR companion going hiking, camping and exploring and then coming home to just hang out.  Of course, a campfire on a cool night would be awesome or even a picnic or simply grilling with friends or family in the back yard.  Jet is just a SIMPLE KIND OF GUY needing a loving family.  Let's find Jet a wonderful home.  If you feel you can provide Jet with a forever, loving home please contact Freedom Street Rescue.\n\nFor questions email pattystavinoha@yahoo.com.

His potential to be an amazing family dog is evident in his sweet and friendly nature. He\u2019s dog-friendly and loves to play with both dogs and kids. He hasn\u2019t shown any aggression and seems to get along well with all dogs he meets, regardless of size or gender.\n\nWhile he\u2019s energetic and still has a bit of puppy in him, Carlos isn\u2019t high-maintenance.

        "description": "Meet Ari! She is fostered in Northern New Jersey but is available for out of state/out of area adoption to the perfect home! Transportation for an out-of-state adoption can be coordinated by our rescue. For more information about our adoption or transportation process, please e-mail our team at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com.\n\n+++\n\nMeet our Ari! \n\nAri is a beautiful 10-month-old Black Lab Mix who was rescued from a high-kill shelter in Texas before finding her way to freedom in the Northeast. Ari was set to be euthanized solely due to lack of space at the shelter - and her time was up. We are so grateful to have had the opportunity to bust Ari out of the shelter. She is young, eager to learn, and has such a bright future ahead of her. \n\nAri is loving, social, and playful. She is the true epitome of a goofy lab puppy. She would thrive in a home with an individual who is eagerly looking for a loyal companion - or with a couple or family who will load her with tons of love and attention. With such a social personality, Ari would be the first to greet new guests at the door at family or friend gatherings. \n\nOn the smaller side for a Lab, Ari weighs about 45/50 pounds. She isn't too tall - and is the perfect 'pocket' sized pup.  Ari is crate trained and is doing very well with her potty training. Routine and structure have been a tremendous help in her house-training success. She is eager to please and notifies you that she has to use the bathroom by standing at the front door. \n\nAri walks beautifully on a leash. Her foster enjoys long walks with Ari. She loves to use her nose and is completely unreactive to other dogs or people on leash. She is a dream to walk and would be the perfect companion to keep someone company on new adventures, hikes, or trips. She is wonderful in the car when she travels with her foster Mom.\n\nAri is a medium/high energy pup. She would benefit from an adoptive home of someone who plans to go on daily walks with her. She LOVES to be outside and would also benefit from having a fenced in backyard. An apartment would not be a good fit for Ari. \n\nFor the active adopter, Ari is your go-to girl for hikes, camping trips, and all things outdoors. She loves adventure and is always ready for a new experience. With her vibrant puppy energy, Ari brings a youthful exuberance to everything she does. She\u2019s eager to please and quick to learn, making training sessions both fun and rewarding. Ari has not had any formal training but would benefit from basic obedience classes to help manage her excitement and to use her brain! \n\nBut the magic really happens when the day winds down. Ari transforms from playful pup to professional snuggler in zero flat, finding that sweet spot in your arms that says, \u201cThis is exactly where I belong.\u201d Ari LOVES being in the presence of her people. She follows her foster from room to room - and is equally as excited to curl up on the couch or in bed with her person.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the lookout for a gorgeous, and affectionate companion to share in all of life\u2019s little and big adventures, Ari is waving her paw in the air. She\u2019s more than ready to fill your days with laughter and your evenings with the kind of cuddles that make everything else fade away. Who knew the perfect adventure buddy also came with built-in snuggle features?\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

        "description": "Cindy Lou is currently fostered in Texas! She is available for out of state adoption to the perfect forever home. For more information on our adoption and transportation process, please email us at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com\n\n+++\n\nWhy hasn't this girl found her forever home yet? \n\nCindy Lou is a 10 month old Labrador/Shepherd mix who is not only beautiful - but intelligent, too! She deserves to find her forever family - and we're here to help her do that.\n\nCindy and her siblings were rescued as strays in Houston, TX where their foster family found them roaming - presumably dumped as an accidental and unwanted litter, which is unfortunately quite common for Texas. Despite this abandonment, Cindy is well-rounded, gentle, sweet, and has a wonderful demeanor. Cindy and her siblings have been raised in an incredible foster home where they have felt love. Cindy is house trained and crate trained - thanks to her dedicated fosters. \n\nNot only does Cindy Lou have her basic indoor manners down-pat, she is also very well socialized with other dogs. She would do very well in a home with another canine companion to romp around with. She has not been tested or exposed with cats. She has not been exposed to small children. Accordingly and with her shy demeanor, we would recommend a home with dog-savvy children over the age of 10.\n\nCindy is currently enjoying a large fenced-in backyard and would love to move into a forever home that can facilitate the same - but a fenced-in yard is not a requirement. An active family who plans to take Cindy on long walks, hikes, or on new adventures would be the perfect match for this girl!\n\nDespite her adventurous side, Cindy Lou has a tender heart. She can sometimes be shy at first - but warms up quickly with a patient hand and treats! \n\nCindy is spayed, heartworm negative, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines. She is very good to have her nails trimmed - and loves playing in the water with her siblings!\n\nIf you're in search of your new companion - and want a combination of beauty and intelligence, please consider giving her a forever home!\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

First my mom gave birth to me and my brothers and sisters under a little white church in a little town and the second miracle is that rescue came to help my mom, Monica and all of us to a comfy place with food and love!  Great rescue folks literally crawled under the church to get us out and our story began......We are now all one big happy family, but my mom says it's time to fly and find our forever homes but most of all she's totally done with the sharp teeth!  Ouch!\n\nBernadette is just an adorable little girl with sparkling eyes looking for her home.  She loves to play with toys and her brothers and sisters and just like human siblings, wrestling and getting loud is always happening.  Bernadette also loves to eat and take lots of naps and cuddle.\n\nBernadette is a little doll and needs a family to love her.  Being that she's a puppy you can train, and she will adapt to her new family's lifestyle.  Bernadette says there's too many siblings and she wants a lot of love and attention!  She is loving, sweet and will bring lots of fun, laughter and love to her new home and she will surely put a smile on your face!  Kisses are free from Bernadette!!!!  If you feel like you can give Bernadette a forever, loving home, please contact Freedom Street Rescue.\n\nFor questions email pattystavinoha@yahoo.com.

        "description": "Meet Petunia, the perfect package of love and charm wrapped up in a compact, 40-pound frame. This 3-year-old black lab mix is a favorite at our rescue, and it's easy to see why!\n\nPetunia\u2019s personality is a delightful mix of calm and playful. She\u2019s a social butterfly who gets along splendidly with dogs of all sizes and even small children. She has an incredible knack for knowing when to be gentle, making her the perfect companion for families. Whether it's playtime with her canine buddies or cuddles with her humans, Petunia knows how to make everyone feel special.\n\nWhen it comes to manners, Petunia is a superstar. She's crate trained, house-trained, and takes treats with the politeness of a British tea party guest. And those big puppy eyes? They\u2019ll melt your heart every time she looks up at you, especially when she\u2019s silently asking for another pet or belly rub.\n\nPetunia\u2019s favorite pastimes include playing with toys, lounging on the couch, and soaking up all the love and attention she can get. She's not just a pretty face; she's also a quick learner who\u2019s eager to please. Whether it\u2019s a new trick or a new routine, Petunia adapts with grace and enthusiasm.\n\nHer gentle and confident demeanor makes her a calming presence, both for humans and other dogs. She\u2019s the kind of dog who will happily nudge her way between you and another dog to make sure she\u2019s getting her full allowance of pets, all while maintaining her regal composure.\n\nPetunia would love a yard to romp around in, but she\u2019s equally content with daily walks with her favorite human and canine companions.

        "description": "Male\nBlack Mouth Cur\n2 years (04/15/2022)\n61 lbs\nNeutered/Microchipped\nCurrent on Shots\n\nGood evening! My name is Gus and I stick by my humans like Velcro! I am a LOYAL, HANDSOME boy who is very SMART and just wants to be with a person or family BUT PLEASE this time a kind human! I have scars on my back possibly from a chemical burn or a fire burn from wherever I came from. My back is all healed now, and I just want a family to love me and to share lots of CUDDLES and love. Animal control picked me up as a stray and I spent some time in the pound until we had a foster home available.\n\nGus is a great boy who is house, and crate trained, loves CRUISING in the car letting his ears fly and feeling free. I bet he would love riding in a jeep! Gus loves stuffy toys even carrying them on walks and he does not destroy them, and he is very well mannered inside and NOT destructive. Gus does well on leash and loves to play tug. He has learned the boundaries around his house when outside and knows not to cross them. Gus sits by the door until his leash is attached before going out. Gus is good with dogs especially his new little girlfriend, Suki. SEE VIDEO. Gus doesn't care for cats. Gus loves to cuddle and is an automatic lap dog (even though he's a little large) and even sits on the outdoor swing with one of his fosters. When his foster goes to bed he goes right to his crate and lays down leaving the door open and sleeps like a baby all night.\n\nGus deserves a chance at a new beginning with a family that won't hurt him and will love and share their life with him and to wipe away all those past memories. He would love to be a part of family vacations and functions. Gus would be a great companion to come home too and would make you happy on sad days. Road trips would be great as well sharing adventures and exploring and just having fun. FYI--a complete stranger came up and sat by the pool and Gus wiggled his way onto her lap and loved every minute. If you think you can provide Gus a forever, loving home please contact Freedom Street Rescue.\n\nFor questions email pattystavinoha@yahoo.com.

Tippy is a sweet and energetic girl who loves to play and is always up for some affectionate petting. Her favorite pastime? Getting all the pets she can!\n\nTippy is a dream on the leash, shows no signs of resource guarding, and is generally a well-behaved pup. She does have a bit of a diva streak when it comes to her food around other dogs and prefers to dine solo, but she\u2019s perfectly fine sharing her food and attention with her humans. In her foster home, she\u2019s fed separately from other dogs and hasn\u2019t had any issues.\n\nCurrently living in a foster home, Tippy gets along well with humans and is especially good with men and women. Tippy adores her humans and would make a wonderful companion dog for someone looking to spend all their time with their new best friend. She does well playing with other dogs, and as with all of our dogs, we recommend slow introductions. (Pro tip: remove any bones during playtime to avoid any diva moments!)\n\nYou might think Tippy would be a high-energy dog because of her breed, but she is very content with short walks and some playtime in the backyard. She settles inside like a dream! Tippy is crate trained and doesn't have any destructive behaviors.\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic dog who\u2019s ready to bring endless joy and excitement to your life, Tippy is your girl. She\u2019s affectionate, loyal, and always up for an adventure. Could she be the perfect addition to your family?

        "description": "Meet Paris\nMeet Paris, a delightful 51 lb female Staffy mix with a personality as charming as her name. Paris is a friendly, affectionate, and well-mannered girl who loves both people and dogs. With her great recall and house and kennel training, she\u2019s an all-around wonderful companion.\n\nParis is a sweetheart who enjoys the company of other dogs and people. She hasn\u2019t been around cats, so her feline friendliness is still a mystery. She\u2019s great with dogs of all sizes and both sexes, and she\u2019s particularly fond of her sister, Nicole. These two are inseparable, providing double the love and companionship.\n\nWhen it comes to training, Paris is a star student. She has no issues with resource guarding, leash pulling, or destructive behavior. She does experience a bit of separation anxiety, but it only lasts for about 5-10 minutes. Overall, she\u2019s a very well-behaved and easy-going dog.\n\nParis lives with a 26-year-old woman and her partner, and she gets along fabulously with both. She\u2019s also good with children, making her a great addition to any family. With a moderate energy level, Paris is content with short walks to the park or just hanging out with her person. She doesn\u2019t require high-intensity exercise, but she loves to be active and engaged.\n\nThis lovely girl is crate trained and sleeps in her crate at night without any fuss. She hasn\u2019t shown any destructive tendencies, making her an easy fit for most homes. Paris is always happy and smiling, with a super smart and quick-to-learn personality. Her loyalty and affection towards her family are truly heartwarming.\n\nParis and her sister Nicole have been through a lot together, and ideally, they would love to find a forever home together. They\u2019re like two peas in a pod, making it feel like you\u2019re caring for one incredibly well-mannered dog.\n\nReady to add a bundle of joy and affection to your home? Paris is waiting to meet you and show you just how wonderful life can be with her by your side. And if you can open your heart to two, Nicole is ready to join the adventure too. Let's give these two sweet girls the happy ending they deserve!\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n+++++++\n\nParis is currently being fostered in Texas and will be transported to her forever home by our rescue!

Ranger is a low-maintenance companion who effortlessly blends playful energy with a laid-back demeanor, making him the perfect addition to any family.\n\nRanger is a sweetheart who absolutely adores being around his family.

Ranger is versatile in his social skills, getting along with dogs of all sizes and both sexes.\n\nRanger thrives in a large yard where he can roam and explore to his heart's content. Despite his size, he doesn't require a high level of activity and is quite content with leisurely strolls or simply basking in the sun. He\u2019s an easy-going dog who would fit well with a less active family or someone who enjoys relaxed, slow-paced walks.\n\nThis handsome boy is also well-behaved when left to roam the yard. He\u2019s not crate trained but has shown no destructive behavior, making him an easy pet to manage.

Yogi is a super sweet boy who obviously came from a loving home. He\u2019s got the basics down pat\u2014he can sit, shake \"paw,\" and is fully housebroken.\n\nYogi loves to be with you all the time and can\u2019t resist a good tummy rub. His favorite pastimes include looking out the window and playing with his beloved squeaky toys. At night, he\u2019s a perfect bed companion, sleeping through the night without a fuss.\n\nHe\u2019s proven to be gentle with children and has even won over the neighborhood kids. This affectionate pup just wants to be loved and will thrive in a home where he\u2019s showered with attention.\n\nYogi has had a bit of a rough patch, having been captured by animal control and spending nearly two months in a shelter. This has left him a bit wary of uniforms, but he\u2019s improving\u2014especially when treats are involved! With the UPS man and the vet, a few treats were all it took for him to calm down and trust them.\n\nCurrently, Yogi is still working on his interactions with other dogs and men, so he would do best as the only dog in a home. He barks at cats and will pull on the leash during walks, but using a harness has helped reduce his struggle.\n\nYogi has medium energy levels\u2014he enjoys short walks but isn\u2019t keen on long walks, especially in the heat. He\u2019s quite content lounging around the house and would be perfect for a less active family who can take him on a couple of short walks a day.\n\nThis little guy is free to roam the house when his foster family is away and has shown no destructive tendencies. Despite his shelter experience, he should be fine with crate training if needed. He hasn\u2019t shown any digging behavior in the small yard available to him.\n\nYogi would thrive with a single lady or a family who can spend lots of quality time with him, even if it\u2019s just cuddling on the sofa. He\u2019s the ultimate snuggle buddy and just wants to be close to you.

        "description": "Meet Waylon\nMeet Waylon, our 24 lb bundle of joy and love! At just 4 months old, this yellow lab mix pup is as sweet as they come. Waylon adores being petted and showered with affection. His favorite pastime? Making friends! He loves playing with dogs of all sizes and genders and is equally friendly with people, though he can be a bit timid at times. He would thrive in a home with another dog and patient owners who will reassure and praise him until he fully gains their trust. Waylon has also been fine around cats and, while he hasn't been around kids, we have no doubt he would love the attention of a loving child.\n\nWaylon is well on his way with his training. He\u2019s crate and leash trained and about 80% potty pad trained. He\u2019s getting the hang of being housebroken and knows to go to the door when he needs to go out, though he occasionally has accidents. We\u2019re working on his fetch game, and he will sit for a treat!\n\nWaylon's friendly and gentle nature makes him a delight to have around. He gets along wonderfully with other dogs, making him a great companion for any household with canine friends. His medium energy level makes him a perfect fit for a family that enjoys playtime but also appreciates some downtime. Waylon loves to play hard but also enjoys laying around and soaking up all the attention you can give him.\n\nWhile he\u2019s crate trained and generally well-behaved, he does have a typical puppy tendency to chew, so he\u2019ll need plenty of toys and gentle guidance to keep him occupied. Waylon needs a bit of reassurance to build his confidence, but with a loving family, he\u2019s sure to blossom.\n\nIf you're looking for a sweet, affectionate, and playful pup to add to your family, Waylon is ready to bring endless joy and love into your home. Will you be the one to give this precious boy his forever home?\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n+++++++\n\nWaylon is currently being fostered in Texas and will be transported to his forever home by our rescue! We have transports departing each week!\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers! If you have additional questions, please email us at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com.\n\n\nNote: As with all of our rescues, we recommend homes with children 10 years and over to ensure the best fit for both the pets and families involved.\n\nCheck out all of our adoptable pups and learn more about our rescue on our website: www.stmuttsrescue.com",

        "description": "Meet Luna, a stunning mixed breed charmer with possibly a dash of retriever, who at just a year and a half old has mastered the art of stealing hearts. Luna tips the scales at 55 lbs and carries the kind of gentle soul that makes her an ideal companion, especially if you\u2019re working from home.\n\nInside, Luna's demeanor is the epitome of calm. She\u2019s content to sit by your side as you tap away at your keyboard, but don\u2019t be surprised if she politely nudges your hand with her head when she\u2019s in the mood for some affection. She\u2019s not shy about asking for pets! Beyond her playful side, Luna is incredibly affectionate and loves to snuggle up right next to you, making her the perfect cuddle buddy.\n\nLuna loves her toys and keeps herself entertained, proving to be the perfect house guest. Plus, she\u2019s 100% potty trained and handles her crate time like a champ. When it\u2019s time to stretch her legs, Luna is nothing short of angelic on the leash. She\u2019s made a host of canine friends on her walks, and her favorite trick is to roll over belly-up during these social sessions, which often leads her new friends to do the same. It\u2019s a sight that guarantees a smile!\n\nThough she's calm indoors, Luna loves the great outdoors. She would thrive with a yard to romp around in, reveling in the joy of the open space. Luna is enamored with all the new smells the outside world has to offer, making her an excellent candidate for hiking, camping, or even just being your running partner. But don\u2019t worry, even a lazy day in the park will make her wag her tail with happiness.\n\nLuna is looking for a home where she can enjoy the best of both worlds: cozy indoor times with plenty of cuddles and vibrant outdoor adventures. If you\u2019re looking for a furry companion who\u2019s as happy exploring new trails as she is lounging by your side, Luna is ready to fill your days with joy and affection. Are you ready to meet this beautiful soul who is sure to brighten your life? Luna is waiting for her forever home, perhaps with you!\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n+++++++\n\nLuna is currently being fostered in NJ and will be transported to her forever home by our rescue!

        "description": "Male\nDogo Argentino, Pit Bull, Dalmation and Bird Dog?????\n56 lbls\n4 years (05/07/2020)\nNeutered/Microchipped\nCurrent on Shots\n\nHi everyone, my name is Olaf and I'm just like the Olaf on Frozen--Optimistic, Outgoing, welcoming and I totally love the 4-year-old twins and all the dogs in my foster home. I did not feel that way as you can see in the picture posted on Facebook when I was found alongside the road. I was on the street starving and alone for some time and I had injuries sustained from a possible car the vet guessed. Again, I am thankful like Olaf on Frozen for little things like food and water and love and for great big things like my foster family stepping up and helping me nursing me back to health.\n\nOlaf has slowly blossomed into a playful loving boy. He DEFINITELY knows he was rescued. Olaf is crate trained and house training is going well. He does well on leash and loves walks and surprised his foster mom by hopping on her bed and taking a nap with her. Olaf is curious about cats, so cats not recommended.\nHe is just a happy boy who loves his foster family, his doggie friends and the little boy and girl living in his home. Olaf also rides well and is learning several commands. The dog identifier on the phone lists several breeds like Dogo Argentino, Pit Bull, Dalmation and Bird dog but it really doesn't matter I'm just Olaf to all.\n\nOlaf has gained a healthy amount of weight, and his wounds are healed and the wound on his head has healed, and the hair is growing back. He is now ready for his forever family to love him, and he will show them everlasting love in return.\nOlaf would be very happy in an active family to go on exciting adventures whether hiking, camping, (he probably would snuggle to keep you warm on cool nights) traveling or whatever makes his new family enjoys. If you feel like you can give Olaf a forever, loving home please contact Freedom Street Rescue.\n\nFor questions email pattystavinoha@yahoo.com.

For more information on our adoption and transportation process, please email our team at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com.\n\n+++\n\nMeet Luna Marie, a charming 7-month-old mixed breed pup with a heart full of love and a personality to match. This gorgeous girl embodies friendliness, affection, loyalty, and a playful spirit that brings joy to everyone around her. Luna Marie is the quintessential couch potato when indoors but transforms into an adventurous soul the moment she steps outside.\n\nAlthough Luna was abandoned at a young age, she has shown remarkable resilience. Her only hurdle is overcoming the initial fear of being left alone again, but once she realizes you\u2019ll return, her trust blossoms beautifully. Luna\u2019s interactions with her foster family, which includes two children, are nothing short of loving and playful, reflecting her gentle nature.\n\nLuna thrives in the company of other dogs, regardless of their size or gender, playing happily with her foster siblings that include a mix of pit bulls, a husky, and a husky/shepherd. This social butterfly is also well-behaved and disciplined; she\u2019s crate trained, potty trained, and walks nicely on a leash without any signs of destructive behaviors or digging tendencies.\n\nFor Luna Marie, the ideal home would be one that matches her energy and zest for life, where she can enjoy routine walks and playtime to keep her vibrant spirit satisfied. She bathes without fuss, settles down easily at night, and exudes charm around the clock. In short, Luna is not just looking for a house to stay in; she\u2019s looking for a home to thrive in and a family to call her own. If you\u2019re looking for a furry companion who is brilliant, brave, and funny, Luna Marie might just be your perfect match!\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

Emilio thrives on playtime, especially when it involves a game of ball with his human companion. He's a social butterfly who gets along famously with other dogs, having happily mingled in groups of up to six without batting an eyelid. While he hasn't had the pleasure of feline company in his presence, his easygoing nature suggests he'd make friends with just about anyone.\n\nEmilio is a well-mannered chap with a knack for listening and learning. He's no stranger to a little mischief now and then, but hey, who isn't? With a bit of guidance and correction, he's as good as gold.

She's a bundle of energy and enthusiasm, loving every bit of life \u2013 from the rustling leaves to the joy of a good toy.\n\nLula's size is just right \u2013 small and compact, yet full of spirit. She's incredibly smart and loves a challenge, which makes her an ideal candidate for agility training. Imagine her acing an obstacle course, then winding down with a cozy cuddle session on the couch.\n\nWhile Lula enjoys the company of other dogs, she's a bit possessive of her toys. So, if she's joining a home with other pups, she'll need a slow and careful introduction, especially around her favorite playthings. However, when she's out and about, minus the toys, she's as sociable as can be.\n\nLula would fit well in a home with older children, given her high energy levels. She adapts well to different environments, whether quiet or lively. Beyond her playful nature, she has a smile that's genuinely infectious and a confidence that's reassuring.\n\nShe's great on trails, loves car rides, and is a fan of water, making her a versatile companion for various adventures. In short, Lula's a delightful, energetic, and confident dog, ready to bring joy and activity to her new forever home.\n\n++++++\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n+++++++\n\nLula is currently being fostered in Texas and our rescue will transport her to her forever home, we have transports departing every week!\n\nWith all of our rescues, we recommend homes with children ages 10 years and older!\n\n",

Transportation can be facilitated by our rescue. For additional information on our adoption and transportation process, please email us at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com.\n\n+++\n\nMeet Renata!\n\nRenata is a beautiful 5 year old German Shepherd mix who was rescued from a high kill shelter in Houston Texas last summer. Fostered in an incredible home since June 2023, Renata has grown into a friendly, goofy, and intelligent pup. She is now in search of the perfect forever home to love her, spoil her, and treasure her - as she so deserves. \n\nTypical of her breed, Renata is intelligent, eager to learn (and please), and driven. 'Reny,' as her foster family fondly calls her, would benefit from a breed-savvy home! She loves new adventures and would be the perfect companion to accompany someone who travels or likes to hike! Already knowing her basic commands and manners (walking nicely on leash and sitting on command), Renata would be a great fit for someone seeking to grow and learn with their new companion! Reny's foster Mom says she is 'one of the smartest dogs I've ever had.' \n\nChasing squirrels? Cats? Reny chases cars! She is working very hard on controlling her excitement by cars passing by, but we think a home away from a road or major highway would be of benefit for our girl! \n\nReny loves hanging out with other dogs, especially playful ones. She's cool with dogs of all sizes and ages, even puppies. However, she's not a fan of alpha dogs - or a dog who will 'check' her. Her play can initially start off as 'rough' play, so a dog who can match or tolerate her play level is a must! \n\nPer Reny's foster Mom, Reny is wonderful with children! She has been walked by the nieces and nephews of her foster Mom (ages 6-12) - and has even done very well around a 2 year old in the home!\n\nBefore being rescued and while spending time in the shelter, Reny allowed volunteers to dress her up happily - giving everyone kisses and soft tail wags.'\n\nLooking for an excitable addition to your life? Renata may be your girl! If you're in search of someone to keep you company on all of your upcoming adventures, Renata is ready to be by your side!\n\n+++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: https://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n+++\n\nFor additional information, please email us at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com.",

Hank is not just another pretty face; he's a sweetheart with a loyal heart and an adventurous spirit, ready to leap into a loving home\u2014quite literally!\n\nHank's athletic ability is as impressive as his loyalty; he can clear a 6-foot fence with room to spare. For this reason, Hank's ideal home would come with a securely fenced yard where he can stretch his legs safely and enjoy the great outdoors without any Houdini acts.\n\nDespite his occasional selective attitude towards some male dogs, Hank is a true ladies' man and gets along famously with all female dogs he meets. He's also had positive interactions with selected male dogs, provided introductions are handled slowly and carefully. Currently, Hank lives harmoniously with humans of all ages, from a 55-year-old woman to a 23-year-old and a 35-year-old man, soaking up affection and showing a particular fondness for male companionship.\n\nEnergy-wise, Hank is an active fellow who would thrive with a family that can provide lots of outdoor play, exploration, and exercise. He's not the type for slow walks; this boy prefers a more vigorous routine to match his high energy levels.\n\nInside the home, Hank is a well-mannered companion with free roam of the house and yard, thanks to a doggie door. He loves his chew toys and engages eagerly in activities that are intellectually stimulating, keeping him both physically and mentally engaged.\n\nHank's story is one of resilience; rescued from the harsh streets of North Houston, this country boy has been fully vetted and treated for heartworms, and he's ready to find a forever home where he can live out his days in happiness and health. He's even mastered a few tricks, like sitting and shaking hands, and is always eager to show off for a treat or a pat.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a loyal, affectionate, and energetic companion to add a little excitement to your life, Hank is your guy. He dreams of a home with a bit of land to roam, a tall fence to respect his jumping skills, and a family to adore him as much as he will them. Don't miss the chance to meet this incredible dog who is all set to become your most faithful friend. Hank is waiting to shake your hand and steal your heart!\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

Beau is the epitome of a companion dog\u2014sweet, friendly, and eager to please both humans and canine friends alike.\n\nBeau is a bright spark, showing off his intelligence and trainability at every turn. He\u2019s a dream to train, always keen to learn new tricks or reinforce the old ones. His friendly nature extends beyond humans to his fellow dogs, as he gets along splendidly with both small and large breeds, embodying the spirit of camaraderie wherever he goes.\n\nCurrently living in a multi-dog household, Beau\u2019s interactions are consistently positive, making him a delightful member of any pack. When it comes to humans, his charm knows no bounds; he thrives on interaction and enjoys the attention bestowed upon him by men, women, and children alike.\n\nBeau boasts a moderate energy level, making him the perfect match for a family that enjoys calm evenings as much as the occasional adventure outdoors. He doesn\u2019t require a large yard or intense activities but appreciates the occasional leisurely walk to keep him engaged and happy.\n\nWhen left alone, Beau is crated, a practice more for safety and comfort as he adjusts to his life beyond rescue. Rest assured, he shows no destructive behaviors and handles his \u2018alone time\u2019 with the utmost grace.\n\nAt our rescue, we proactively test all of our dogs for heartworm, a common issue in the southern United States. Although Beau is not showing any symptoms, he tested positive and is currently receiving treatment, which is fully covered by our rescue. He is expected to make a full recovery and continue living a full, healthy life.\n\nBeau is not just house-trained; he's a gentleman of the highest order, waiting patiently to be part of a loving family\u2014be it with a single owner, a couple, or a house full of kids. His affectionate and gentle nature makes him an excellent candidate for anyone looking for a loyal, loving pet to complete their family.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a well-mannered, sweet-natured dog to fill your home with joy, Beau is ready to step into your life and heart. He\u2019s not just looking for a house to live in\u2014he\u2019s looking for a home to thrive in.\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

These three-month-old, 22 lb bundles of joy were rescued from a high kill shelter in Texas, and they're on a mission to find a forever home that's bursting at the seams with love and patience.\n\nMarco, with his sun-kissed yellow coat, and Polo, donning a sleek black fur, are like two peas in a pod\u2014different on the outside but with hearts of gold. They're still finding their feet in this big, wide world, so they're looking for someone who can guide them with gentle hands and kind words, helping them blossom into the confident, goofy boys they're meant to be.\n\nA big yard for Marco and Polo would be like a dream come true. Imagine them zigzagging through the grass, playing their own version of hide and seek (where Marco finds Polo, and Polo finds Marco, and so on\u2014it's a never-ending game with these two!).\n\nThese sweet boys have already been through a lot, but their spirits remain unbroken. They're ready to fill your life with laughter, love, and maybe just a little bit of lab-induced chaos. If you've got the heart to match their boundless energy and the home to let their personalities shine, Marco and Polo might just be the adventurous companions you've been looking for. Let's turn their tale of survival into a story of thrival.\n\n",

Always ready for a romp or playdate, Peri loves interacting with other dogs and is known for her playful spirit in the kennel\u2019s play groups.\n\nCurrently residing in a kennel environment, Peri is eagerly waiting for a chance to show just how loyal and devoted she can be. She\u2019s demonstrated a wonderful ability to get along with other dogs she\u2019s met, though she hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to charm any small dogs just yet.\n\nWhile Peri\u2019s full range of likes and needs are still unfolding, she\u2019s shown no signs of food guarding, leash pulling, or other common challenges. Peri would love a big yard where she can stretch her legs and run to her heart\u2019s content, but her eagerness to please makes her equally content with an adopter who prefers leisurely walks.

        "description": "Meet Oliver, the striking 3-year-old Siberian Husky who could easily be the James Dean of dogs. With his impressive 62-pound frame and steely gaze, Oliver isn't just another pretty face; he embodies the independent, intelligent spirit of his breed. He's the kind of dog who would look right at home on a Harley, cruising down the highway, or nonchalantly posing with sunglasses and a leather jacket.\n\nOliver's demeanor is as cool as they come. He's not the type to seek out constant affection; he's more of a 'hang out beside you' rather than 'curl up on your lap' kind of guy. His energy level is moderate, making him a great match for a family that appreciates brisk walks and active play without going overboard. Oliver is treat-motivated\u2014a surefire way to win his attention and loyalty\u2014and while he\u2019s not one to make a fuss or try to Houdini his way out of the yard, keeping him mentally stimulated is key to his happiness.\n\nDespite his somewhat aloof nature, Oliver isn't one to shy away from company. He's well-behaved with other dogs and has a gentle mouth, which makes him suitable for families with older children. He doesn\u2019t jump up or startle easily, but potential adopters should be familiar with the grooming needs and the engaging environment a Husky requires.\n\nCurrently residing in a kennel environment, Oliver interacts well with everyone he meets, though he has a touch of what some might affectionately call 'snobbery.' He's crate trained and shows no destructive behaviors, even when left alone, reflecting his well-mannered disposition.\n\nOliver's backstory includes being rescued from the streets. He\u2019s a survivor, now looking for a forever home that understands and respects his breed's traits and his unique personality.\n\nIf you're looking for a loyal companion with a touch of enigmatic charm and the soul of a wanderer, Oliver might just be your perfect match. He promises to be a steadfast friend and an interesting fellow to all who understand the heart beneath the husky exterior.\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

        "description": "Meet Roscoe, the 2-year-old Catahoula mix who's a gentle giant with a heart as big as his 65 lb frame. Roscoe is your quintessential lap dog trapped in a big dog's body, always ready to cuddle up but just as eager to play and please.\n\nRoscoe is a bundle of love and loyalty, with a fondness for toys\u2014balls, in particular\u2014and an endless capacity for affection. He\u2019s incredibly food motivated, making his training sessions both fun and rewarding, though he\u2019s still perfecting his leash skills. He\u2019s a big boy who doesn\u2019t quite understand his size, so a home with older children would be ideal, and he'd prefer a cat-free environment as he tends to see them as a chase challenge.\n\nCurrently, Roscoe is enjoying his days with Molly, a Carolina dog who matches his playfulness. While he hasn't been introduced to all the dogs in his current foster home, he's shown no signs of aggression towards any dogs he's observed from a distance or through barriers.\n\nOne of Roscoe's favorite pastimes is going for car rides. He absolutely loves to hop in and feel the breeze on his face, making every trip an adventure worth savoring. Whether it\u2019s a quick jaunt around town or a longer excursion, he\u2019s always ready for the ride.\n\nRoscoe\u2019s past may have had its rough patches\u2014he was found following two teenagers around after having been subjected to less than kind treatment by a previous owner, evident from the BBs under his skin and his cautiousness around taking food directly from hands. Despite this, Roscoe's resilience shines through. He expresses his gratitude through big smiles, especially when you scratch under his chin, and has learned to trust again, showing affection with a polite kiss after his meals are set down.\n\nActivity-wise, Roscoe is as versatile as they come. He\u2019s as happy to lounge by your side as he is to play in a yard. He doesn\u2019t need an overly active family but enjoys having space to roam and explore. He\u2019s well crate trained and if given enough mental stimulation and chew toys, he shows no interest in being destructive.\n\nRoscoe is looking for a forever home where he can continue to learn that the world can be a kind place, where he can give and receive love freely, and where his sweet nature will be cherished. If you're looking for a loyal friend who will adore every moment spent with you and bring joy to your days with his big, heartwarming smiles, and who loves car rides as much as he loves playing, Roscoe is ready to meet you and start your wonderful journey together.\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

        "description": "Meet our girl Tiny!\n\nTiny is currently fostered in Texas, but is available for out of state adoption. We are also looking for a foster or foster-to-adopt home for her. For more information on our adoption and transportation process, please email us at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com.\n\n+++\n\nTiny is - well - tiny! This beautiful Border Collie mix is quite petite at only 35 pounds! She has such a sweet and bubbly spirit despite her life of neglect. At only 1 year old, Tiny is forgiving - and has so much ahead of her. We are excited for her to find an individual or family who will love her for the remainder of her life.\n\nTiny was rescued by a family in Texas after a few weeks on the run around town. Her original family, who had her as a puppy, no longer wanted he and accordingly, they dumped her outside to fend for herself. Initially timid in new environments and with new people, she warms quickly when shown love and patience. \n\nDespite her timid nature (initially), Tiny has done well with children. We would recommend a home with children over the age of 12 for this sweet but shy girl.\n\nTiny has also done very well with other dogs and lives with her foster buddy, Stevie, currently! We would prefer to find a home for Tiny with another confident dog who can show Tiny the ropes in her new home! Tiny has not yet been tested with cats. \n\nTiny is doing very well with her house training. Due to her life of neglect - and being on the run as a stray - she would benefit from a family willing to be patience, but work with her on basic manners and obedience! She is described as well behaved by her family, but she has so much more to learn at such a young age!\n\nFor more info on this sweet girl, please email us at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com.\n\nTo apply to adopt Tiny, please complete our adoption application below:\n\nYou can find my form \"Saint Mutts Rescue Adoption Application\" at: https://form.jotform.com/210515484620146",

Weighing in at 30 pounds of pure energy, Sandy's favorite activities include running, jumping, and generally embodying the spirit of a whirlwind.\n\nSandy is a puppy with enthusiasm to spare. She loves to explore the world with boundless curiosity\u2014whether that\u2019s through a spirited game of chase or a joyful bout of rolling and bouncing. If you\u2019re looking for a sidekick for your outdoor escapades or someone to help burn off some energy, Sandy is your girl.\n\nDespite her high-octane lifestyle, Sandy has been learning the ropes in her foster home.

If there were a social butterfly award at doggie daycare, Piper would be the reigning champ\u2014she absolutely adores her fellow canines. Whether it's a day filled with play or just hanging out with her two foster siblings, Piper is all about that dog pack life. Cats? Well, the jury's still out on those mysterious creatures.\n\nBefore making her grand entrance to NY, Piper spent some time with a pet sitter where she proved she\u2019s as good with small humans as she is with dogs. She\u2019s got a soft spot for kids, showing off her gentle and playful side in equal measure. However, when it comes to the gents, Piper can be a bit reserved at first. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s not a fan; she just likes to play it cool, taking her time to warm up. But give her a moment, and she'll show you her true, affectionate colors\u2014especially if you're a woman. Then it's all love, all the time.\n\nPiper is the epitome of playful energy followed by blissful naps. She can go from 100 to zero in the blink of an eye, transitioning seamlessly from play mode to serious couch potato. Cuddling up with her foster mom for some quality relaxation time is high on her list of favorite activities, making her the perfect chill companion after a fun day of adventures.\n\nPiper is not just looking for a forever home; she's on the lookout for a forever family that can match her love for life and companionship. With her wonderful, playful spirit and her boundless affection, she's ready to bring joy, laughter, and a touch of playfulness to any family lucky enough to call her their own.\n\nIf your home is in need of a four-legged bundle of joy who\u2019s sure to keep you on your toes (and then help you relax on the couch after), Piper is your girl. She\u2019s ready to make every day brighter, every play session more fun, and every cuddle session cozier. Are you ready to welcome Piper into your heart and home?\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

His athletic nature makes him a sight to behold in action, but it\u2019s his attentive demeanor and eagerness to please that truly capture the heart. Ricky isn\u2019t just playing; he\u2019s engaging, always looking to his person for cues and approval, making him an ideal candidate for further training.\n\nWhat we adore about Ricky, aside from his playful bobbed tail and spirited antics, is his deep connection with his humans. He's as attentive as they come, with a gaze that seems to understand just what you need. This attentiveness translates beautifully into his eagerness to learn and please, making him not only a joy to be around but also a dream to train. He\u2019s the kind of pup who thrives on positive reinforcement, always seeking that nod of approval that says, \"Good job!\"\n\nBut Ricky is looking for more than just a casual relationship; he's on the lookout for his forever best friend. Someone who appreciates his blend of fun-loving energy, athletic ability, and the kind of loyalty that looks for guidance and approval. He's ready to be your sidekick in every adventure, offering his heart and companionship for a lifetime of shared moments and achievements.\n\nIf you\u2019re dreaming of a faithful companion who combines athleticism with an earnest desire to be by your side, look no further. Ricky is ready to fill your life with laughter, love, and the kind of dedicated friendship that only a dog of his caliber can offer. Are you ready to be the person Ricky looks up to? Because he\u2019s more than ready to start that journey with you.\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

She's particularly attached to her primary caretaker, offering a level of loyalty and love that's hard to match.\n\nIn the canine realm, Mama's motto is \"friends, not foes.\" She's a diplomat, getting along with dogs of all sizes after a polite, slow introduction. However, it's a no-go zone with cats, as her idea of play doesn't quite align with our feline friends.\n\nMama's adaptable nature means she's as happy in an active household as she is in a more laid-back setting. Whether it's a big yard for exploring or leisurely strolls around the neighborhood, Mama is content as long as she's with her people. Left to her own devices, she prefers the freedom to roam around the house or yard, with a slight penchant for chewing when she's feeling bored or confined.\n\nThe ideal home for Mama? A kingdom where unconditional love reigns supreme. She's not just looking for a place to stay; she's in search of a forever family ready to embrace her loving, gentle spirit. A family that understands the value of a good cuddle, appreciates the art of play, and offers the companionship she cherishes will find in Mama a loyal, affectionate companion who's ready to give her heart completely. Are you ready to welcome this lovable princess into your home and heart?\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

        "description": "Meet Sid, the epitome of canine enthusiasm wrapped up in a 55 lb package of joy and fur. Sid's the name, and making you fall head over heels in love with him is his game. Picture this: a 1.5 year old Mountain cur mixed breed dog with the heart of a puppy, regardless of his size. He's the kind of buddy who's always up for a game of fetch, tossing the ball around like he's training for the doggy Olympics. And let's talk about his social skills - Sid is the life of the paw-ty! He doesn't care if you're a Great Dane or a Chihuahua, a feline friend or a human kid; to him, you're all part of his circle of friends.\n\nSid's the adventurous type; give him a car ride, and he's all eyes out the window, tongue flapping in the breeze, probably daydreaming about his next big adventure. Affection is his middle name, and he's not shy about showing it. Whether you're a bustling family looking for an extra dose of love, a solo adventurer in need of a hiking buddy, or just someone who enjoys leisurely walks, Sid's ready to fill that spot by your side with gusto.\n\nCurrently, Sid's living the good life in a home boarding setup, mingling with dogs of all shapes and sizes. It's a regular United Nations of dogs there, and Sid? He's the ambassador, getting along with every canine diplomat he meets.\n\nFor Sid, life is an endless adventure, but he's not the type to need non-stop action. A medium-energy family with a decent-sized yard would be his ideal scenario. He's got energy to spare, but he's just as happy with frequent, leisurely strolls as he is with a big backyard romp. And yes, he's crate trained, so no worries about him redecorating your living room when you're not looking.\n\nSid's looking for a home with a bit of space to roam, someone who enjoys walks as much as he does, and perhaps the occasional visit to the dog park to socialize and show off his fetching skills. If you're looking for a four-legged friend who's all heart, boundless energy, and a smidge of goofball, then Sid might just be your perfect match.\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

He\u2019s the kind of pup who\u2019s never met a stranger or a dog he didn\u2019t want to be best pals with. Known to sit for treats\u2014and pretty much anything else if you ask nicely\u2014Dempsey makes learning new tricks as fun as a game of fetch.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all about the tricks and treats. Dempsey lives for the great outdoors, whether that means exploring the wilderness on a hike or just taking in the sights and smells of a new walking path. And after a day of adventure, there\u2019s nothing he loves more than doling out puppy kisses, convinced that cuddles are the secret to world peace.\n\nLooking for a furry companion who\u2019s a mix of comedian, adventurer, and snuggle buddy? Dempsey is ready to fill your life with laughter, love, and a dash of delightful mischief. He\u2019s not just looking for a house to live in; he\u2019s looking for a family to enchant.\n\n+++++++\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n\n+++++++\n\nOnce we have received your application, we will review and reach out to set-up an interview with one of our volunteers!

These three-month-old, 22 lb bundles of joy were rescued from a high kill shelter in Texas, and they're on a mission to find a forever home that's bursting at the seams with love and patience.\n\nMarco, with his sun-kissed yellow coat, and Polo, donning a sleek black fur, are like two peas in a pod\u2014different on the outside but with hearts of gold. They're still finding their feet in this big, wide world, so they're looking for someone who can guide them with gentle hands and kind words, helping them blossom into the confident, goofy boys they're meant to be.\n\nA big yard for Marco and Polo would be like a dream come true. Imagine them zigzagging through the grass, playing their own version of hide and seek (where Marco finds Polo, and Polo finds Marco, and so on\u2014it's a never-ending game with these two!).\n\nThese sweet boys have already been through a lot, but their spirits remain unbroken. They're ready to fill your life with laughter, love, and maybe just a little bit of lab-induced chaos. If you've got the heart to match their boundless energy and the home to let their personalities shine, Marco and Polo might just be the adventurous companions you've been looking for. Let's turn their tale of survival into a story of thrival.\n\n",

Champion is a pro when it comes to leash manners, strolling next to you like a gentleman, all while eyeing up any treat you might have to offer.  He is always a good sport- showing off his playful side and inviting other dogs to join in with a friendly play bow.\n\nBack in his kennel, Champion is the king of his castle, engaging with his enrichment toys (a Kong or rawhide are among his favorites) with all the gusto of a dog who knows the value of a good play session. This boy doesn't just enjoy life; he celebrates it every chance he gets.\n\nChampion is dog-friendly, human-friendly, and pretty much friendly with anyone who's ready to match his zest for life. He's not just looking for a home; he's looking for a forever family that's ready to embrace all the love, laughs, and tail wags he's got to offer. If you're looking for a furry companion who's guaranteed to keep you smiling, Champion might just be your perfect match. Open your heart to this sweet soul, and let's turn his temporary stay into a lifelong championship of love and happiness.\n\n++++\n\nTo apply to adopt Champion, please complete our application below:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n \n++++\n\nChampion is currently fostered in Texas, but will be transported to his forever home by our rescue.

But don't let her initial shyness fool you; Peaches is a master actress, waiting for her cue to show you her true colors.\n\nThe moment you meet, she greets you with the kind of stretch that says, \"Finally, my human has arrived!\" Leashing her up is a breeze, and before you know it, she's leading the expedition outside with an eagerness that's contagious. Give her a moment to acquaint herself with the great outdoors (a sniff here, a sniff there), and suddenly, it's showtime! Peaches transforms into the life of the party \u2013 zoomies, playbows, and an impressive display of grass angel skills.\n\nAnd treats? Let's just say if love could be measured in treats, Peaches would be an endless fountain of affection. Watch in awe as she springs into the air, a move so graceful and energetic you'd swear she's part boxer. It's a sight to behold, her leaping with joy, four or five feet off the ground, all for the love of a good snack.\n\nDespite her scars, which tell a tale of survival, Peaches's spirit remains unbroken. She's as friendly and loving as they come, with a minor case of hair loss that's nothing a little TLC can't fix. Her tail is a perpetual motion machine, especially when meeting other dogs through the fence \u2013 all happy wags and polite sniffs, a testament to her gentle soul.\n\nPeaches isn't just looking for an owner; she's looking for a co-adventurer, someone who appreciates her for the sweet, silly girl she is. She may not have mastered the art of fetch, but she's got the 'bring joy' part down to a science. After a spa day and some love, she'll be ready to conquer the world \u2013 or at least the living room.\n\nSo, here's to Peaches, a pup as sweet as her namesake, ready to roll in the grass and bask in the sun of her forever home. She's a testament to resilience, joy, and the power of second chances. May her next chapter be filled with endless treats, belly rubs, and the loving home she so richly deserves.\n\n++++++++++++\n\nAdoption Application\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\n++++++++++++\n\nPeaches is being fostered in Texas, our rescue will transport her to her forever home, we have transports departing weekly!\n\nWith all of our rescues, we recommend a home with children ages 10 years and older.

        "description": "Dana is the epitome of a sweet girl! With a sparkling spirit, she's always eager to learn new things and showcases impeccable obedience. \n\nTemperament: Dana is an incredibly loving and affectionate pup. Despite her past experiences, she remains joyful and exudes a playful demeanor around other dogs. She is also very smart and eager to please her humans, making her easily trainable. In just a few days, she has already learned commands like \"sit\" and \"down,\" which speaks to her intelligence and willingness to learn.\n\nTraining and Exercise: Dana's intelligence and eagerness to please make her highly trainable.  Our trainers often rave about how Dana is one of the best leash-walkers they've ever had. This lovely lady responds positively to corrections and is always eager to do her best. Given her active nature, regular exercise and playtime will be essential to keep her happy and healthy.\n\nAffection: Dana comes alive outside and her playful side shines! Once inside, she settles down nicely and craves human affection. She loves cuddling and being close to her humans, making her an ideal companion for those who enjoy spending quality time with their furry friend.\n\nWhat Dana's Looking For:\n- A patient family that understands the beauty of growth. Dana deserves a home that will give her the time she needs to adapt and flourish, nurturing her budding confidence every day.\n- Although she loves to play and gets along with her canine friends, Dana would truly shine as an only pet. She deserves all the love, snuggles, and attention you can offer.\n- A household with rescue experience would be a match made in heaven. Dana has been through a lot and deserves to be understood and cared for in the best way possible.\n\nDana's Backstory:\nDana had a rough start in life, this brave girl was found abandoned in a kennel on the side of a highway in the peak of summer. We suspect she might have spent most of her life in a kennel as she tends to circle when in her crate. But every day, with love and care, she grows stronger and more confident. Despite the pain she must have endured, Dana's loving nature shines through, and she has a bubbly and affectionate personality.\n\nSpecial Note:\nDue to Dana's unique sensitivities, she would thrive best in a home without children. Let's give this girl the peaceful and loving environment she so rightfully deserves!\n\nIf Dana sounds like the perfect fit for your family or if you\u2019d like to meet her, please get in touch. She's waiting for her forever home! If you can help give Dana temporary foster home, please complete our foster application.\n\nFOSTER APPLICATION:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210404198518151\n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re interested in potentially adding Dana to your family, please complete our adoption application.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\nhttps://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\nIf you have any questions about Dana, please do not hesitate to email us at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com",

        "description": "Name: Murphy\nBreed: Collie Pyrenees Mix\nAge: 1 year\nDisposition: Working breed\n\nAbout Murphy:\nMurphy is a one-year-old Collie Pyrenees mix who is looking for a home where he can put his working breed instincts to use. He is an active and intelligent dog who thrives on having a job and purpose in life.\n\nPersonality:\nMurphy is a dedicated and hardworking dog with a strong work ethic. He is known for his intelligence and is quick to learn and follow commands. He is an alert and attentive companion who is always ready for a task. While he may be serious and focused during work, he can also be affectionate and loyal to his human companions.\n\nWork and Job Requirements:\nAs a working breed, Murphy requires a home where he can have a job or specific tasks to engage his mind and energy. This could include activities such as herding, agility training, or participating in dog sports. Murphy will excel in an environment where he is given the opportunity to work and use his natural instincts. Regular mental and physical stimulation is essential for his overall well-being.\n\nTraining:\nMurphy is a highly trainable dog due to his intelligence and eagerness to work. He will benefit from consistent and positive reinforcement training methods. With the right guidance and training, he can become a well-behaved and reliable companion. Engaging in activities that challenge his mind and provide structure will help fulfill his working breed needs.\n\nActivity Level:\nMurphy has a high activity level and requires regular exercise to stay happy and content. Daily walks, runs, or engaging in activities that simulate his working instincts will help burn off his excess energy. Providing him with sufficient physical exercise and mental stimulation will contribute to his overall happiness and prevent behavioral issues that may arise from boredom.\n\nIdeal Home:\nMurphy would thrive in a home where his working abilities can be utilized. Owners who have experience with working breeds or have a background in dog training would be well-suited for him. A home with a large securely fenced yard or access to open spaces would be ideal. Murphy needs an owner who understands his needs for mental and physical stimulation and is committed to providing him with a purposeful life.\n\nIf you are looking for a dedicated and active companion who thrives on having a job, Murphy might be the perfect match for you.

        "description": "Hello there! I'm Chico, a friendly and playful 6 year black mouth curr mix, and I'm on the lookout for my forever companion. Are you ready to be my best friend? Let me tell you a little bit about myself and what I'm looking for in a forever home.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'm a champion lounger. I love spending my days inside, relaxing and enjoying the comforts of home. However, when I step outside, that's when the real magic happens! I come alive with energy and excitement. Playing fetch is my absolute favorite pastime, and there's nothing quite like the thrill of chasing a ball. If you're up for a game of fetch, count me in!\n\nI'm also a fan of long walks, especially when I have a loving human by my side. There's something about the fresh air and exploring new surroundings that truly brings me joy. Im a big boy, close to 70lbs, but you don't have to worry about me overpowering you, I walk beautifully on a leash and always leave slack in the line bc I really like being close to you! It's the perfect opportunity for us to bond and create lasting memories together.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is that I just completed my training program, and I'm proud to say that I know all my commands. I'm a quick learner and can follow cues like sit, down, place, and many more. I'm eager to show off my skills and impress you with my obedience. What me in action at the link below:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088241135668&mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nWhen it comes to my ideal home, I would do great as an only pup. I can provide you with all the love, loyalty, and companionship you need. However, if you have a female sibling playmate in mind, I would be more than happy to have a furry friend to share my adventures with. I have a friendly and sociable nature, so getting along with other dogs is not a problem for me.\n\nIf you're looking for a loving and loyal companion who enjoys both relaxation and outdoor adventures, then I just might be the perfect match for you. Let's spend all our days together, making each other's lives brighter and more fulfilling.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting me, please reach out! I can't wait to meet you and embark on this incredible journey of friendship and companionship together.\n\nYou can find my form \"Saint Mutts Rescue Adoption Application\" at: https://form.jotform.com/210515484620146\n\nIf you have any additional questions about Chico, please email us at SaintMuttsRescue@gmail.com\n\nFind out more about our rescue on our website:\nhttps://www.stmuttsrescue.com",

He is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and is able to transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nThis litter was rescued from a shelter in Houston when they were at risk of euthanasia. The puppies are now old enough to start finding homes of their own. We included a picture of Mom, Sally, for reference (she is 56 pounds). \n\nHulk is described as a goofball with a silly, playful personality and is the biggest of his litter. He loves chasing and wrestling with his siblings, and is a good-natured fellow who rarely is caught sitting still for photos.\n\nHulk is not fully housebroken and has spent some time crated, but generally spends time in a pen with his siblings. We are looking for a home who understands this comes with the territory of raising a young puppy. \n\nHulk has not been around cats but is being fostered with kids ages 5-15 years old. We always recommend a home with kids who respect and understand animal boundaries. For younger kids, we expect parents who will supervise and help teach appropriate animal manners. \n\nHulk is looking for a home who has an understanding of raising puppies into adulthood. This can be prior experience or someone who will seek support as needed (training, friends/family). Puppies bring so much joy, but also need intentional and committed attention. They need help socializing with new people, other dogs, leash work and basic obedience. \n\nPuppies under 6 months of age are placed on a spay/neuter contract until they are old enough to be altered. \n\nFor puppies this age, someone needs to be home more than they are away as crating them for long periods of time is not conducive for their developmental needs. If you work outside of the home longer than 4 hours, please explain who will is available to spend time with this puppy while you are aware. If that information is not included, we will not consider your application. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nMeet the Superhero Litter! \n\n\nMystique, 9 weeks (estimated DOB May 2024), female, Carolina Dog/Retriever mix, estimated to be a medium/large size when full grown. She is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and is able to transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nThis litter was rescued from a shelter in Houston when they were at risk of euthanasia. The puppies are now old enough to start finding homes of their own. We included a picture of Mom, Sally, for reference (she is 56 pounds). \n\nMystique is described as the sweetest of the litter, loving and affectionate in personality. Her best friend is her brother, Patriot.\n\nShe is not fully housebroken. She has spent some time crated, but generally spends time in a pen with her siblings. We are looking for a home who understands this comes with the territory of raising a young puppy. \n\nShe has not been around cats but is being fostered with kids ages 5-15 years old. We always recommend a home with kids who respect and understand animal boundaries. For younger kids, we expect parents who will supervise and help teach appropriate animal manners. \n\nMystique is looking for a home who has an understanding of raising puppies into adulthood. This can be prior experience or someone who will seek support as needed (training, friends/family). Puppies bring so much joy, but also need intentional and committed attention. They need help socializing with new people, other dogs, leash work and basic obedience. \n\nPuppies under 6 months of age are placed on a spay/neuter contract until they are old enough to be altered. \n\nFor puppies this age, someone needs to be home more than they are away as crating them for long periods of time is not conducive for their developmental needs. If you work outside of the home longer than 4 hours, please explain who will is available to spend time with this puppy while you are aware. If that information is not included, we will not consider your application. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nInterested in applying to adopt her?

Patricio is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nPatricio ended up at a crowded shelter before he'd even had his first birthday.  At approximately 9-10 months, Patricio loves hard. It\u2019s clear from his drive-by snuggles and how he attempts to join every family he meets at the dog park that while he was found as a stray, he was well-loved in his prior life.  He will make a fantastic addition to an active family who will enjoy doing activities with him.\n\nPatricio's foster family has 3 dogs with whom he enjoys endless hours of play. Wrestling and chase are his favorite games if he can entice one of the siblings to join.  When the resident dogs are too tired or grouchy to play, he will happily entertain himself by finding a toy to chew on.  All toys are chew toys to this silly boy! He\u2019s been a very respectful boy of the house and hasn\u2019t chewed on anything other than the things intended for him. \n\nWhile he hasn\u2019t had many kids to play with at his foster home, he has engaged with some at the park.  He is a lover of all humans, however his active play style is better suited for older kids who can understand puppy play.  He has learned not to use humans for chew toys \u2013 however especially with kids, this will need to be reinforced in his new home.   \n\nPatricio gets an A+++ for leash manners \u2013 he walks calmly with a loose leash, doesn\u2019t pull, and doesn\u2019t harass the squirrels, ducks, or even the swans he encounters! He calmly passes other dogs or humans on a walk.\n\nPatricio happily hangs in his crate when he\u2019s alone.  Just a little treat as positive reinforcement to get him to go in and then he will have a nice snooze while you\u2019re gone!  Due to his foster\u2019s schedule, he hasn\u2019t been left for more than 4 hours but could easily work upward from that timeframe as he now understands crate=calm rest. Patricio is a very smart boy. He is fully potty trained and has quickly learned everything we\u2019ve worked on! He is incredibly responsive to positive reinforcement with any sort of food.\n\nThis all-around VERY GOOD BOY Patricio is going to make someone a very lucky dog parent \u2013 he\u2019s full of love and fun, silly energy. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Stanley is in a foster home in San Antonio, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nStanley is a playful and energetic guy! He shares a home with another dog. He has also gone to stay at one of our boarders when his foster is out of town. He has met so many new dogs on those visits. He has met dogs big, small, different breeds, all ages and both genders. He is playful by nature, which we would expect given he is a young guy with lots of life. You will find this guy running with the pack, greeting new dogs and having the best time. \n\nStanley has been around a few kids (ages 5-12y) with other temporary fosters while his Main Foster Mom has been out of town. The feedback has been positive but that he takes longer to warm up to men/boys.  No matter the age of kid, we typically advise homes with kids who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. We have no history with cats.\n\nStanley is mild-mannered on the leash and walks calmly but does pull. His foster mom is working with him on this but his new family may find that a harness or Gentle Leader head collar work better to manage his pulling. Stanley is fully house and kennel trained. He's proven trustworthy while in the house unsupervised (he's non-destructive and doesn't have accidents). He is crated for longer periods of time and does great. \n\nAll dogs are fed separately as a rule of his Foster but she notes there have been no signs of aggression or resource guarding when another dog sniffs at his food while he's eating. He has no issues sharing toys, treats or bones and shows only moderate interest in people food.\n\nStanley is active and loves to get his energy out, and would be best served with a yard of his own. He currently spends a lot of time in the backyard playing with the other dogs and/or would enjoy some dedicated play time. He enjoys walks and runs, playing ball, and having something to chew on. He doesn't need to have another dog in the house but it would be helpful, especially one of similar age and size.\n\nHe's silly and goofy and an embodiment of the pittie personality (cuddly and affectionate especially at bedtime, dramatic and vocal, energetic and athletic). He loves water and will try getting into the shower or bath, even though the water is hot. He would thrive with a breed experienced adopter who is willing to pour time and attention into him, training and teaching him good manners. He would enjoy being a running partner and going on active adventures. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Cotton is in a foster home in San Antonio, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nHi! My name is Cotton and I was saved by Dizzy Dog from San Antonio ACS. When I came to my foster home I was really skinny and a little scared. :( My foster parents think I would really like a friend to play with.  I can lay and entertain myself in the yard, although I sometimes play with things I shouldn't like the plastic pots and yard tools, so don't leave those out!  \n\nI have very expressive blue eyes that look like I have eyeliner on.  My ears are also great -sometimes they are up like a German shepherd and sometimes they are down. I cross my legs when I lay down and wait for a treat.  I know how to sit and shake. I'm really very smart!\n\nI'm not sure how old I am but probably still young since I do have a lot of puppy energy! I've not been around many kids before and because I can be really excited to say hi, it's probably best if any kids in my life are older like 10-12+? I REALLY love attention! I love to be petted and if I can sit in your lap, I will! Once I get lovings I calm down. I don't really know how to play with toys so I probably didn't have many before I got here.  \n\nI love going on walks and do really really well on the leash, not pulling and walking calmly next to you. I have never had an accident in the house and will go into my crate if you ask me. I won't make a mess there either but sometimes I get anxious and scratch at my bed in the crate so I prefer being with my people.  I love to lay on the bed with you too, or just next to or even under your bed!\n\nI have a spot on my back that doesn't have any fur on it.  My foster parents think I may have been burned by something or someone.  They put cream on it to keep it soft, It's a little sensitive when it's touched but it doesn't seem to hurt. \n\nI'd love to be your new furbaby! I promise to love you a lot! \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/DDAR/Dog\n\n\nCeline Dion, 3.5 years old, spayed female, Weimaraner/Mountain cur mix, 58 pounds. She is located in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nCeline was saved from euthanasia at a county shelter in Houston. The shelter listed her as a Husky mix, but we see other breeds. We are taking our best guesses in terms of the breeds we listed, but imagine she is made up of other breeds too.\n\nCeline is a young and energetic pup still mastering the art of play. While she loves the idea of making new furry friends, her play style can be a bit intense. She did wonderfully with a very tolerant 75-pound husky, but her jumpy and in-your-face approach was too much for some of the other dogs. Celine is eager to play and, with a little more guidance, she's sure to become a well-mannered playmate. \n\nWhen it comes to playtime, Celine is all about high energy. She can romp around with the best of them but does settle down after a while. She's learning to pick up on cues from other dogs, though there are times when her husky friend had to be vocal to get her to stop. Celine has been exposed to dogs of various sizes but mainly played with larger ones. \n\nMeeting new dogs on walks has generally been positive for Celine. She pulls a little initially but calms down quickly. Her interactions on the leash are friendly and wagging tail without much excitement. After some basic manners training, she\u2019s become quite good at walking alongside her foster siblings.\n\nWe have no history with cats. Celine loves people and has done well with a 12-year-old child in her foster home. She can be slightly jumpy, but with a few weeks of manners training, she has improved significantly. She would likely be best suited for a home with children over 5, ensuring a playful but safe environment for everyone.\n\nCeline is enthusiastic about walks, pulling a bit at first but settling into a loose leash stroll after a few minutes. She loves to sniff everything, showing her curious nature. She is fully housebroken, Celine has adapted well to being crated. Though she didn\u2019t like the crate at first, she now goes in willingly for meals or treats and can stay crated for extended periods if needed.\n\nCeline has shown no issues with food aggression. There have been no problems with toys, bones, or treats. She\u2019s also comfortable with people around her food.\n\nCeline would thrive in an active home with a yard and daily activities. She has a moderate to high energy level and would benefit from having another playful dog companion. However, she may also do well as the only pet in an active household.\n\nCeline is playful, silly, and curious. She loves playing with toys and is very affectionate. When meeting strangers, she shows no signs of fear and is generally calm. In the car, she can be a bit nervous and may pant, but with more car rides, she\u2019s likely to get more comfortable.\n\nCeline is a loving and spirited dog looking for an active home where she can continue to learn and grow. With her playful personality and eager-to-please attitude, she\u2019s sure to bring joy and laughter to her forever family.\n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

She is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and is able to transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nThis girl is more vocal than her siblings. She loves cuddle time and pets. She has a silly personality!  \n\nThis litter was rescued from a shelter in Houston when they were at risk of euthanasia. The puppies are now old enough to start finding homes of their own. We included a picture of Mom, Sally, for reference (she is 56 pounds). \n\nShe is not fully housebroken. She has spent some time crated, but generally spends time in a pen with her siblings. We are looking for a home who understands this comes with the territory of raising a young puppy. \n\nShe has not been around cats, but is being fostered with kids ages 5-15 years old. We always recommend a home with kids who respect and understand animal boundaries. For younger kids, we expect parents who will supervise and help teach appropriate animal manners. \n\nHarley Quinn is looking for a home who has an understanding of raising puppies into adult hood. This can be prior experience or someone who will seek support as needed (training, friends/family). Puppies bring so much joy, but also need intentional and committed attention. They need help socializing with new people, other dogs, leash work and basic obedience. \n\nPuppies under 6 months of age are placed on a spay/neuter contract until they are old enough to be altered. \n\nFor puppies this age, someone needs to be home more than they are away as crating them for long periods of time is not conducive for their developmental needs. If you work outside of the home longer than 4 hours, please explain who will is available to spend time with this puppy while you are aware. If that information is not included, we will not consider your application. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

If someone other than yourself is part of the decision making process, please make sure you have spoken with them and they are on board. We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nBambi, 10 months old, spayed female, Plot Hound/Mountain Cur mix (best guesses), currently 30 pounds so full grown will be in the medium range.  We are not completely sure all the breeds that make up this pup, so your guess is as good as ours! She is in a foster home in SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nMeet Bambi, an adorable and energetic pup with a heart full of love and curiosity. This young dog is still finding her way in the world, and with a little patience and training, she\u2019s sure to become a wonderful companion.\n\nBambi loves to play with other dogs and has a high-energy play style. She's eager to make friends and engage in friendly play, although she sometimes plays a bit hard. She\u2019s smart enough to pick up on cues when another dog wants to stop playing and has had positive interactions with dogs her size, like beagles and Jack Russell beagle mixes. When meeting new dogs, she starts off nervous but quickly warms up and becomes friendly. She recently went to a dog park and made friends with everyone there! \n\nWe have no history with cats. Bambi has shown that she can be nervous and timid around children at first. However, once she gets to know them, she becomes friendly. We recommend a home with kids who understand and respect animal boundaries.\n\nWalking on a leash is a bit of a challenge for Bambi. She tends to freeze and throw herself on the floor, showing she\u2019s confused and needs some leash training. She also pulls on the leash, so she'll benefit from a patient handler to help her learn.\n\nBambi isn\u2019t fully housebroken yet and tends to pee when she\u2019s excited or nervous. She\u2019s been crated and does well as long as there\u2019s nothing in the crate with her. If there\u2019s a bed inside, she might have accidents. The longest she\u2019s been crated is overnight. \n\nBambi is an active pup who needs regular walks, playtime, and plenty of attention. She\u2019s best suited for an active home that can provide outdoor activities and ample playtime. She doesn\u2019t necessarily need another dog in the home to keep her company. However, it would be important for her to be around other dogs to maintain her positive social manners. \n\nBambi is an independent, timid, and nervous pup who transforms into a playful, smart, and silly dog once she gets comfortable. She loves being petted and is very affectionate. She enjoys playing with toys and is curious about everything around her. When meeting strangers, she tends to be timid and nervous, often freezing and keeping her distance before hiding behind her foster momma. Once given some time, she will approach new people with a wagging tail. \n\nBambi has a unique and adorable habit of leaping like a deer from the grass to the top of the porch, completely disregarding the stairs. Bambi would thrive in a home with children who can play with her daily or an active person who enjoys taking her to parks and on hikes. She needs a family that can provide her with the attention and playtime she craves.\n\nBambi needs a patient family as she\u2019s still a puppy. She has a habit of jumping when being fed and nibbling on hands or legs when walking. Despite these quirks, she\u2019s very loving once she trusts you. Bambi is a sweet and energetic pup looking for a loving home where she can grow and thrive. With a bit of training and a lot of love, she\u2019s sure to become a loyal and cherished member of your family.\n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Vero is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nVero is in a home with two small female dogs (10 and 20lbs) and had no issues meeting or playing with the girls, although she can play pretty rough. She's still a puppy so her play skills are still being learned but she is never aggressive and has begun to pick up on when to leave other dogs alone. \n\nShe's very friendly to dogs and humans alike. She doesn't have any issues with sharing toys or food and does not need to have a canine sibling - she is confident enough on her own.\n\nMatter of fact, Vero is an absolute lover - she jumps up for hugs and kisses, will climb up into your lap and lay her head down for pets. She's cuddly and affectionate and has never met a stranger, everyone is a friend she just hasn't kissed yet!\n\nVero lives with two kids aged 8y and 10y, and had no issues at all. In general, we recommend homes with kids over the age of 10y or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. She does live in a home with cats and has improved in her behavior around them. She initially enjoyed chasing and barking at them, but now is calmer and leaves them be.\n\nVero is leash, house and crate trained. She is exuberant when first getting to go outside so she may dart forward but she settles down quickly and walks with ease. She alerts when she needs to go outside and has not had any accidents in the home, and is quiet once in her kennel. She does need (or demand, your choice) to be lured into the kennel with a treat but she has no issues once in.\n\nShe knows sit and throws paws and will do nearly anything for a treat. She lets you dress her up in silly costumes and doesn't fuss with them at all. Vero enjoys playing with toys and would thrive in an active home with lots of outlets for her energy - walks/hikes, doggy day care or play dates, puzzles, etc. She could benefit from some basic training - she is still a puppy so she jumps up a lot and can get into things she shouldn't - but overall, Vero will be the perfect dog for the luckiest family!\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\n\nFlorence (Flora), 3 years old, spayed female, Carolina Dog mix, 60 pounds. She is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nFlorence, affectionately nicknamed, Flora, Flory, Lory, or Sweetpea, is a playful and energetic dog who loves to wrestle and be chased. She would do best in a home with dogs of similar size and energy level. When playing, Flora could play for hours.  She loves to interact with another dog in the home, Furman by licking his face. Flora has experience playing with dogs ranging from a 35-pound Cocker Spaniel to a 60-pound Pyrenees mix.\n\nFlora requires slow and guided introductions to other dogs. She has shown some leash reactivity, exhibiting behaviors like raised hair, whimpering and barking. Her foster parents have worked with her on this behavior. When she is off leash, she easily makes new friends. \n\nFlora\u2019s compatibility with cats is unknown. She adores the 8-year-old child in the home, but is nervous of new children. While she has done well with children aged 6-11, she tends to bark  at new kids, especially when they move around quickly. Therefore, Flora is best suited for homes with children aged 10 and older.\n\nAs mentioned, Flora has some leash reactivity and gets easily spooked, often pulling a lot. However, she has made progress with positive reinforcement and minimal stimuli. She walks much better in calm environments with less activity.\n\nFlora is fully housebroken. She has demonstrated some anxiety in the crate at home. When her foster parents have gone out of town she has gone to boarding where she is crated with no issues. At home, she is able to be out of a crate and unsupervised with zero issues. She is fed separately from the other dogs in the home.  Otherwise, she shares her toys well and has no issues with people and food, although she needs reminders to take treats gently.\n\nFlora has high energy needs and requires dedicated outdoor playtimes to do well inside the home. She thrives in a moderately active home with regular outdoor play sessions. Flora would benefit from having another dog in the home to boost her confidence and match her energy.\n\nFlora loves playing with the other dog in the home, enjoys talking, bucking around the yard, eating, going for walks, sunbathing, and birdwatching. She is a total love bug and enjoys snuggling. She does well in the car but is terrified of storms, often seeking shelter in a closet or burying her head in a lap.\n\nFlora\u2019s ideal home would be with someone who is often around, enjoys walks or jogs, and will play fetch with her. A home with another dog of similar age, size, and energy level, and possibly a child, would be ideal. Flora needs an owner who will continue positive reinforcement to help with her anxiety. Flora is very smart, loves learning new tricks, and is very submissive and affectionate.\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Blinky is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nBlink and you might miss him! This boy is energetic and high energy, enjoying nothing more than playing with 2- and 4-legged friends.  Blinky is in a foster home with three resident dog brothers (40-90lbs) and does well. He's very social and enjoys being the life of the party! He tends to match the energy of the other dogs- so if someone wants to play he will engage. If they are more chill, he follows suit. \n\nBlinky is very kid friendly and has been around children ages 6-12.  Blinky can be a jumper so normal caution should be exerted to ensure he doesn't accidentally knock over a child. He is very friendly! \n\nBlinky has been in a home with cats and ignores them. \n\nBlinky is leash, crate, and house trained with great success. He is very curious on a leash and likes greeting other dogs. He has not been left loose while unsupervised as of yet but has proven to be non-destructive thus far. Blinky does best in a kennel when riding in the car.\n\nWhile he wants all of the attention, Blinky is happy to share his food, toys, and treats with his foster brother and has shown no issues guarding resources. Blinky eats his meals loose with the resident dogs but it's always a good idea when introducing a new pet to feed in the crate to ensure healthy boundaries and to reinforce a positive connection with the crate.\n\n A moderately active family would be his ideal. He would enjoy having a canine sibling but could also thrive being the only apple of your eye. He is quite cuddly and loves to receive affection. He is outgoing and friendly, and has not shied away from meeting new people or new experiences. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

She shares a foster home with 4 other dogs (her sister was recently adopted). She has great manners with other dogs and we would really prefer to see her in a home with another dog. If there is not a dog, please indicate how you plan to socialize her. \n\nShe is housebroken, but does have an accident here and there. She has been crated and is doing well.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nJake, 2yr old, neutered male black labrador/pit bull mix, 75 pounds. Jake is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nJake was found wandering the streets of a Houston neighborhood with a pregnant female companion. When he was taken to the city shelter, he was in rough shape\u2014infested with fleas, losing his hair, and looking very skinny. Fortunately, he was rescued by Dizzy Dog, and his journey to recovery began.\n\nJake can be a bit clumsy at times, but he has the sweetest personality! He absolutely loves going to new places in the car and meeting new people (he never passes up a chance at getting some attention ?) and animals! He has occasional bursts of energy but a short game of fetch or running around the backyard with a dog friend is enough to tire him out. After which, he enjoys sunbathing on the patio. He also loves a chill 20-30 minute walk! Each night while we are making dinner, he lays calmly on the kitchen floor. He never begs for human food, just wants to be close to us!\n\nJake has never met a dog he doesn\u2019t like. He loves all dogs, both big and small! He is great at adjusting his play style to match the size and energy level of other dogs. He plays gently with smaller dogs and is more energetic with larger ones. On leash, he gets excited when he sees other dogs and occasionally jumps around because he wants to play with them. This behavior has decreased with regular daily walks but still happens occasionally. He thrives in environments where he can interact and play with other dogs, making him a great companion for multi-dog households.\n\nWe have no history with cats nor kids but due to his size and playful nature, we recommend a home with children aged 12 and older. He doesn't intend to hurt anyone, but his size and the way he moves when he is excited could be too much for younger kids.\n\nJake tends to pull with a regular harness, but he walks great with a gentle leader. He has made significant progress in getting used to it and knows it means it's time for a walk. With a gentle leader, he walks calmly with me. However, he does jump around a bit in excitement when he sees squirrels, people, or other dogs. This is improving with regular daily walks and exposure to these triggers.\n\nJake had three accidents in the house when we first got him, each one happening right after he ate. These accidents occurred when he was fed in our kitchen, not in his kennel. Now, we make sure he is fed on our patio or goes outside immediately after eating. Since implementing this routine, he hasn't had any accidents, and it\u2019s been several weeks. Additionally, Jake does not chew on things he shouldn't when he is out of his kennel. Jake has come to feel very comfortable in his kennel, sleeping soundly from 9:30 PM when he happily runs into it until about 7:30 AM. He also goes into the kennel easily during the day if we have to leave the house, especially with a frozen Kong to keep him occupied.\n\nJake does not need to be fed separately. He either eats in his kennel or next to our Weimaraner in the kitchen or on the patio. He shows no aggression with toys or treats, but he sometimes takes the toy Bonnie is playing with, as they have a rougher style of play with each other. He doesn\u2019t have this same style of play with any of our other dogs.\n\nJake has a moderate energy level and can tire out with regular light physical activity, such as a 30-minute walk, a game of fetch, or running around the backyard with one of our dogs. He would thrive in a home with another dog of similar size to play with. While he loves playing with dogs of all sizes, having a more playful companion his size would be ideal.\n\nIf we are home and he is in his kennel, Jake does bark quite a bit because he can hear us in the house. We rotate our dogs throughout the day, so he is in his kennel some of the time while other dogs are out (this rotation is done because of our dogs, not him). He would likely do fine in his kennel if we weren't in the house where he could hear us. With a consistent routine and positive reinforcement, his separation anxiety has decreased immensely. He usually settles down after a few minutes with a frozen Kong to entertain him.\n\nJake is great at playing with small dogs, often adjusting his play to their level. Despite his size, he is gentle and backs off if they feel overwhelmed. He loves to play and seeks peaceful interactions. Aside from being great at playing with small dogs, he is SO tolerant of them barking or growling at them when they first meet. Our littles were a bit scared of him due to his size at first and he just let them explore and sniff him and get comfortable.\n\nHe loves to cuddle and be close to his people, whether lying next to you or at your feet. He is a loyal companion who enjoys being around his family. He has good manners and does not beg for food during meal times, making him a pleasant companion during meals. He is very intelligent and a quick learner. He didn\u2019t seem to know any commands when we first got him, but within a few days, he had already learned to sit, wait, and come. He is very treat-motivated, which makes training easy and effective.\n\nJake would thrive in a loving home that offers a balance of physical activity and affectionate family time. He would do best with a family or individual who enjoys moderate physical activities, such as daily walks, backyard play, and occasional games of fetch. Having another playful dog of similar size would be perfect for Jake, as he loves playing with dogs and enjoys having a companion. Jake\u2019s new family should understand his past experiences and be patient with his separation anxiety. He has made great progress but may still whine or bark initially when crated. A consistent routine and positive reinforcement will help him continue to improve.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nInterested in applying to adopt him?

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\n\n\nMilo, 3 years old, neutered male, Pitbull Terrier mix, 53 pounds. He is in a foster home SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS and is able to transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nMilo was abandoned at a dog park in 105 degree heat. Animal control was called and he was picked up and taken to the county shelter. He was later placed on the euthanasia list and we scooped him up! We find it really hard to not love this guy!!\n\nMilo is a bundle of energy and joy! He loves playing with other dogs and goes full speed during playtime. His playful nature is best suited for a home with an active lifestyle. While he gets along well with dogs of all sizes, he's still learning when to stop if the other dog isn\u2019t interested in playing. Milo is friendly and loving towards people, including kids aged 5-7, though supervision is recommended due to his energetic personality. \n\nMilo shares a home with two other dogs (male and female). He will be best suited in a home with another dog who wants to engage in play. He has met other dogs outside of the home and has been very friendly. \n\nMilo is good on a leash, though he may pull slightly when he sees other dogs. However, he quickly refocuses with treats and walks nicely by your side. He is fully housebroken. He knows the \u201ccrate\u201d command and goes straight to it. He does well in the crate for 3-4 hours but make sure both latches are securely closed, as he\u2019s a clever escape artist. \n\nHe has a silly and mischievous personality. He will try to steal food/bones from the other dogs so feeding separately is advised. It is hard to find him not smiling for pictures. \n\nMilo loves running, playing fetch, LOVES water activities, toys and bones. After a day of play, he loves to cuddle and would love to sit in your lap if you would let him. He rides great in the car. He has done wonderful riding around on a boat too. He is very intelligent and easy to train. He loves to meet new people. He can b clumsy at times, tripping over his own feet. We think this only adds to his charm. \n\nWe have no history with cats, but think he would want to chase them. \n\nMilo is looking for an active home. He needs physical outlets throughout the day. He would do well with another dog or would do fine as the only dog. He is looking for a home who will continue to provide structure and basic training. Milo is an affectionate, energetic, and playful dog who will bring joy and laughter to a loving home that can match his spirited nature!\n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

She is in a foster home in SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS and is able to transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nThis girl is sassy and always on the move! She has a big personality in a little body. She shares a home with several other puppies and adult dogs. She is always jumping on them, chasing and just being an energetic puppy. \n\nTulip was saved from what we believe is a backyard breeder. Her foster mom was in a rural area helping to save some dogs on the street. She stumbled across a home where one of the adults surrendered Tulip. We are not sure why, but are grateful she is in our care. \n\nShe is now housebroken but would not be surprised if she had a few accidents in a new home. She has spent some time crated. \n\nShe has not been around cats or kids. We think she would do well with kids who both understand and respect animal boundaries.\n\nShe is extremely sweet and cuddly. She loves to sleep with her foster mom and was very excited when she was able to jump on the couch herself! We think she will be about 30-35 pounds when she is full grown. \n\nTulip is looking for a home who has an understanding of raising puppies into adult hood. This can be prior experience or someone who will seek support as needed (training, friends/family). Puppies bring so much joy, but also need intentional and committed attention. They need help socializing with new people, other dogs, leash work and basic obedience. \n\nPuppies under 6 months of age are placed on a spay/neuter contract until they are old enough to be altered. \n\nFor puppies this age, someone needs to be home more than they are away as crating them for long periods of time is not conducive for their developmental needs\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nDaphne, 2 years old, spayed female, Cattle Dog/Terrier mix, 40 pounds. She is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport out of State to an approved adopter. \n\nLike so many of our dogs, Daphne was on a euthanasia list at the county shelter in Houston. She is currently in a foster home with another dog. \n\nDaphne is a friendly and adaptable dog who quickly bonds with other dogs and enjoys playing with them, adjusting her energy level based on her companions. She is generally quiet and has low to medium energy at home, though she can be high energy and barky in certain situations. Daphne is good at reading other dogs' cues during play and gets along well with dogs of all sizes and breeds.\n\nShe enjoys playing chase and can be quite energetic, especially with dogs who match her energy level. She attends a doggy daycare a few days a week and has a great time! She is comfortable playing with all sizes and breeds, with no reported issues.\n\nWe have no history with cats. She has met and hung out with a 13 year old child (they do not live in the home) . She was initially nervous that resolved quickly into playfulness. She enjoyed the snuggles and pets. We recommend a home with kids 8 years and older. \n\nShe walks nicely on a leash with minimal pulling, comfortable walking at your side or slightly ahead. She is fully housebroken and is initially vocal when crated alone, but does settle down. When you are home and she is crated she prefers being able to see you or to have the crate door open. \n\nDaphne shares toys and treats with and around her foster brother. She enjoys rope and plush toys, likes to chew on them.\n\nShe thrives in an active environment, whether indoors or outdoors; would do well in an apartment or condo with moderate activity levels.\nShe bonds quickly with dogs and benefits from having another dog or active family members for company.\n\nDaphne prefers gradual introductions to new people and can be overwhelmed in busy social settings; not aggressive, but cautious and flighty. She likes car rides but needs to be secured due to moving around.\n\nDaphne would thrive in a home where she can stay active and engaged, with opportunities for play and exercise. A family willing to provide patient introductions and steady companionship would be ideal. She enjoys affection and cuddling, especially at night.\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nInterested in applying to adopt her?

Katy is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nKaty has not had the best start to her life but she does not let it get her down. Her foster describes her as the sweetest, SWEETEST pup you will ever meet. She is cuddly and affectionate, and you will fall in love with her piglet grunts. She sits and stares at you with soft, squinty eyes and showing her sweet smile. She curls up in the tightest ball ever to fit next to you, but only after pretending she\u2019s unable to climb up on the couch or jump on the bed. Of all her foster parent\u2019s dogs, Katy stands ahead of them all as her most favorite hands down.\n\nKaty lives in a home with two other resident dogs but has limited interaction with them as they can be prickly, and Katy has a more assertive personality. She\u2019s had the opportunity to play with other dogs but does not pick up well on the cues they\u2019re done playing and tries dominating them by pinning them and standing over them. She\u2019s never bitten but we initially would advise an only dog home, or slow introductions with a more submissive/easy-going and well-balanced dog. Her foster has been doing a lot of work with Katy to help positively socialize her and notes improvement in this area. \n\nKaty is moderate energy \u2013 silly with her zoomies and enjoys throwing her toys around. She enjoys long walks but is more of a couch potato who sleeps in her bed all day while her foster works. She would enjoy hikes or car rides to the vet or a park, or just being with her people. She LOVES being the center of attention and will  follow you around like a shadow. She\u2019s curious and cuddly, silly and playful, and is most deserving of a home of her own with someone who is patient and understanding.\n\nKaty can be a bit shy around strangers, especially when they are introduced to her in the house. Her foster has been working with her a lot and Katy has improved mightily but she will love you forever if you first meet her outside and then come into her home. \n\nKaty has exceptional house skills \u2013 she\u2019s fully house trained and happy in her kennel, settling down quickly when her foster family leaves. She\u2019s fed in her kennel and has come to associate her crate with safety and comfort. She\u2019s not been left loose while unattended but her foster notes she probably could, as she has not demonstrated any destructive behaviors thus far. She does well on a leash and gets better every day, working on improving her loose leash walking and ignoring dogs she sees along the way.\n\nKaty has not been around any kids but based on her excitement at receiving pets (she loves to toss her head back when cuddling and look up at you lovingly) and preference for her \u201cthings\u201d to be left alone, we would recommend a home with older kids (10+yr). In general, we recommend homes with kids old enough to understand and respect animal behavior cues. We do not have any direct history with cats but Katy has encountered the strays in her neighborhood and watches intently, attempting to chase. If cats exist in the home, we recommend very slow introductions and supervised interactions.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nDex, 3 month old, intact male, American Staffordshire Terrier, 20 pounds. Dex is in a foster home in San Antonio, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up! Adult male pitbulls weigh 40-65 pounds when fully grown.\n\nPuppies are placed on a spay/neuter contract until 6 months old, when they are able to be altered and their adoption finalized. Puppies this age also require someone who is home more than they are away as being crated for long periods of time is not conducive to their growth. If you are gone more than 4hrs at a time, you need to have a plan ready for their care in your absence. \n\nDex and his brother, Bobby, were abandoned in an apartment lot, observed by the residents being forcibly dragged out of the truck and dumped before their \"owner\" sped off leaving the puppies to fend for themselves. The boys, covered in fleas and malnourished, waited there until help intervened. Thankfully, due to fosters stepping up, we were able to save both boys and change the course of their fate.\n\nDex lives in a home with resident and foster dogs all his size or bigger (10-15lbs up to 40lbs), and is very active, as you would expect from a young pup. He enjoys wresting and playing, and can sometimes be too much for the older resident dogs, although the other foster and Dex get along like gangbusters. He takes redirection well and knows when to settle down or leave his siblings alone, and continues to improve on reading their cues every day.\n\nDex is still learning leash and house skills, and his new home should be willing to continue investing time and training in these areas. He's not had much experience on the leash and still darts around like a little madman when first leashed up, but he does settle down into an easy walk after some time. He's not yet house trained but does use potty pads and will not poop in the house. He follows the lead of his canine siblings and goes outside to potty, but does still have regular accidents in the house that crating helps. Dex is crated when his foster is at work and at night, and does well overall.\n\nDex is fed away from the other dogs not because he is food aggressive but because he's a voracious eater and will sneak away to steal the other's food. He loves treats and toys, and is a good sharer. \n\nHis foster mom describes him as very affectionate, super smart, playful and silly, and independent and curious. He does not need another dog in the home but should have plenty of opportunities - whether play dates, dog parks or doggy day care - to continue his positive socialization. \n\nHis ideal home would have kids to chase him around and cuddle when he's ready for naps and be fairly active. He will need lots of physical and mental stimulation to burn off that puppy energy and ensure he does not develop any bad habits due to boredom.\n\nWe have no history with cats, but Dex has been around his foster's young (3yo) grandchild and did excellent - no jumping or nipping, just sweet affection and respect for their respective sizes. In general, we recommend homes with kids over the age of 10yrs or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nMEET KIERSTEN\n\nKiersten is a 5 YR old, 52 lb, spayed female, American Bulldog Mix. She is in a foster home in Houston, TX. She can be transported to an approved adopter. \n\nYour new cuddle buddy Kiersten would be the perfect addition to any home. She loves to play with both dogs and humans and still gets the zoomies in the evening. She's a happy girl who sticks by her people and aims to please. She enjoys walks and still has lots of pep in her step. She's medium energy and gets two walks a day and some play time. She loves to play tug or fetch! Once she knows you're her person, this girl melts into you and is the sweetest thing. \n\nWhen initially meeting Kiersten, she may be a bit shy but one pet from you and she'll be your new best friend. Her sweet, playful, and obedient demeanor make her an excellent dog for new or experienced owners alike. She grows very attached and loves her people. We believe she'd make an excellent dog for a family with older kids as she gets happy bursts of energy that may not be suited for younger kids. She has been around children ages 5-13 yrs and did well with them. Sometimes, she can be a bit mouthy when playing but stops when corrected. \n\nKiersten loves other dogs. She loves to play hard but is good at adapting to the play style of the other dogs and has no issues picking up on ques. She's generally very sweet and submissive with both dogs and humans. She has played with dogs both big and small. When she sees other dogs she gets very happy and excited and wants to say \"HI!\" but if you need to redirect her from them on walks, she's happy to keep walking with you. We do not know how she is with cats at this time, but think she might have a good temperament to be around one. \n\nSweetie Kiersten is the ideal good girl. She takes direction very well and is not destructive in the house. Her foster family is able to leave her in the home uncrated with no issues. This girl is totally housebroken! She's currently not crate trained, but that has not appeared necessary due to her excellent behavior. We have also not observed any food aggression issues with her. \n\nThe ideal home for Kiersten is one where she gets to play and get lots of love and cuddles from her humans.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nAuroral 1.5 years old, spayed female, Pitbull mix, 42 pounds. She is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\n\nAurora and her 7 puppies were found on the streets of Houston. They were taken to the county shelter where they eventually found themselves at risk for euthanasia. A foster home stepped up to save them all! Aurora was very skinny when we first took her into care and has really filled out with proper care. She is a young dog who was probably a mom long before she should have been. \n\nAurora is a lively dog with a zest for play and a heart full of affection. Her play style with other dogs is exuberant and vigorous, often involving chasing and wrestling with dogs of similar size, typically around 40-60 lbs. She's not one to back down from a rough-and-tumble play session, and she enjoys the company of other energetic pups. She can come on strong in her play and is best suited for other dogs who are balanced in their playstyle. \n\nWhen it comes to her energy level, Aurora is an excited girl. She's always raring to go and loves engaging in activities that keep her moving and entertained. \n\nAurora's interactions with other dogs are generally friendly and enthusiastic. She wags her tail and eagerly pulls towards them in a welcoming manner. However, she may need some guidance in recognizing when another dog has had enough, as she might not immediately sense when it's time to dial down the playfulness. \n\nShe's a work in progress when it comes to leash manners but responds well to guidance and training. She likes to pull to greet either people or other dogs. In terms of house and crate training. \n\nWe have no history with cats or kids. We recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nAurora is generally well-behaved but may indulge in chewing on furniture or objects when she's bored. Providing her with plenty of toys to chew on helps keep her entertained and prevents destructive behavior. She's crated when no one's home, typically for around 4 hours at a time, and she settles down after a brief period of protest.\n\nAurora's ideal home would be with an active family who can keep up with her energy and provide plenty of opportunities for play and exercise. While she's affectionate and loves cuddling up with her humans, she also needs outlets for her energy levels, such as outdoor activities and playtime with toys. Training to help her learn to be calmer and more mindful of boundaries would be beneficial, along with a household that understands her need for space and attention.\n\n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nHope, 2 years old, spayed female, Retriever mix, 42 pounds. She is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nHope's story is really why we rescue. Her foster mom was driving to the airport in Houston when something caught her eye off the highway. She still does not know why she pulled over, but she did. This side of the highway was covered in trash- clearly a dumping ground. She walked around and spotted a dog (Hope) sitting on top of a crate with two puppies inside. She immediately called for help and the whole family was moved into a temporary foster until she returned from her trip. \n\nHope is a resilient dog and we are excited to find her an adoptive home. Both of her puppies have already been adopted. Hopefully it does not surprise you that upon meeting new people Hope will give out a bark. This can happen when her foster's friends or family come over or out on a walk. She needs some reassurance, baby talk or some treats and she learns quickly you are a friend. She is not mean acting and we know she does this because she is just unsure. \n\nShe now shares a foster home with two other adult resident dogs. She is always wanting to play and loves other dogs. Her foster mom thinks she trusts dogs more than she does people. She is can be fairly active when first meeting and has come a long way in her manners and picking up on ques. We anticipate in a new home she will need some time to adjust to any resident dogs. She will be best suited for another playful dog. \n\nAs noted above, when she is walking by herself she is more uncomfortable passing people/dogs she does not know. When walking with her four legged friends, it's clear she feels more at ease. She does tend to pull on leash and will need continued practice in this area. \n\nWe do not think she is cat friendly. She has not been around kids, so we suggest a home with kids 10 years and older. She can get the zoomies and have spurts of energy. \n\nHope is fully housebroken and really loves her crate. She has not shown any issues with food or treats around the other dogs or with humans. She is playful, silly and affectionate once she has time to know you. She LOVES bones and toys that are food dispensers. She would really love to cuddle 24/7 if you let her. She rides great in the car- jumps in and seems to enjoy the ride. \n\nShe was a great mom to her puppies- protecting them until they were rescued. One of her puppies had a vision impairment and she helped her navigate. She is obsessed with belly rubs. Hope is looking for a home with another dog to keep her company and build her confidence. She would love a home who is active and will be patient with her as she navigates new faces and surroundings. \n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

He had this really long tail that did not fit his body and was causing \"happy tail.\" This basically means in all of his excitement his tail would hit anything in site causing it to bleed. The tail is never able to heal and after consulting with a vet we had part of his tail amputated. He has recovered well, but his hair is still growing back on that area. \n\nMax spent some recovery time in a boarding facility where he ran his heart out with other dogs. He met allll kinds of dogs- big and little, male and female. He loves to play and run around. There is another dog in the foster home. She tends to be really forward with new dogs and this has made Max a little scared. He does great on walks with her, but in the house he tends to keep his distance. We think he would love another dog to match his personality or would also be okay as the only dog too. \n\nAs you can imagine, given his younger age he is an energetic guy. He is looking for a home with moderate physical outlets. He enjoys his walks and playtime with his foster parents. He is friendly when passing other dogs on leash. \n\nHe has come across cats out walking and appears curious. He has not lunged or tried to run after them, but we can't speak to how he would do in a home setting. We have no history with kids and recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nMax walks okay on leash and will pull when he wants to sniff things. He is housebroken and does well when crated. \n\nHe is a curious and playful dog. He can get a little scared of loud noises or sudden movements. He loves to play fetch and chew on stuffed toys. He rides well in the car, is generally a happy guy always wagging his now nub and excited to see his people. \n\n \n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\n\nFlor, 6 years old, spayed female, Bulldog mix, 85 pounds. She is in a foster home in Houston, Texas and is able to transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nWe will first note that this girl has been on a weigh loss program with her foster mom haha. She has another 10 pounds or so to go, so will need a home that will continue to monitor her food intake. \n\nFlor is incredibly friendly and happy to socialize with any human- big or small. Her foster parents had a small house party and she did so great meeting a lot of new people. She has been around kids as young as 10 years old and loved all the pets and scratches. We always recommend homes with kids who both understand and respect animal boundaries. \n\nFlor was previously in a foster home where she did fine with the other dogs. Unfortunately, she was left out unsupervised and when that foster came home found that one of the resident dogs had attacked her. She immediately received vet care and was moved to a new foster home. Due to this, we have had her assessed with a trainer to see if there were any repercussions regarding her attitude towards other dogs. She did really well meeting other dogs. Our trainer noted she was tense/nervous at first, but quickly adapted and great skills. He noted she will do best with slow introductions and around another dog who is confident. \n\nHer current foster home does not have other dogs. She has met dogs out on walks and even had one stranger ask if their dog could play with her. She was very sweet and did really well. We want to add slow introductions look like initial separation and having the dogs only interact on walks over the first few days. From there, you continue to monitor until you feel comfortable with off leash interactions. She has not shown any aggression and does not react negatively to new dogs. \n\nWe do not think she is cat friendly based on her running to chase and bark after stray cats in the backyard/neighborhood. \n\nFlor will initially pull on leash and stops after a little while. She really really loves walking. Our hope is her forever home would enjoy walks with her too. She is crated when her foster parents are out of the house and does well. She is fully housebroken. We have found that she prefers her water bowl is inside her crate otherwise she doesn't drink water. Not surprising, she is very excited for treats and can be a little over excited when taking them from your hand. Her foster mom makes her wait and encourages her to take them gently. \n\nShe tends to match whatever energy her people have. Her current home is lower energy and she does just great. Her foster mom thinks if another home was more active, she would have no issue keeping up. She rides really really well in the car. She is SUPER affectionate. \n\nHer foster mom says this about her, \"Flor is a super silly, sweet, loving girl, she is independent  and loves to be with her humans. She will be your shadow.\"  She loves belly rubs and picks up on things very quickly. When she is really exited she hops like a bunny or tap dances! \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

She is currently in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nCandace and her brother were supposed to be with a short term stay with one of our fosters through her local shelter. She asked us if we could help network them so here we are :)\n\nWe are not sure everything that Candace is mixed with! We do think she will be larger once she is full grown. She is an energetic and active puppy. \n\nCandace shares a foster home with her brother and several other adult dogs. She absolutely needs a home that is able to engage her physically. She should have another dog companion for her to continue to learn and develop her social skills. \n\nShe is housetrained but will note she has access to the outside and is not left unsupervised. Her foster mom has not seen any accidents. She does well when crated. We anticipate in a new home some struggles in these areas. We always want a patient home who will work with her through that transition. She has not had much leash training, so will need some work in that area. She rides well in the car. She LOVES water and if it's deep enough he will be in it! \n\nCandace is an explorer and more outgoing in that way than her brother. Her foster home has a large space for her to check things out. She does like affection and will cuddle with you on the couch. \n\nThere are cats in the current foster home and she was actually a little scared of them.  She tends to steer clear and leaves them alone. She has not been around kids and we think she would do fine. We always recommend a home with kids who understand and respect animal boundaries. A home who understands she is a puppy who may jump up or knock into you and is still learning. \n\n\nFor puppies this age, someone needs to be home more than they are away as crating them for long periods of time is not conducive for their developmental needs. \n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

He is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and able to transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nThis guy is such a lover who loves BIG. He was saved from euthanasia at a county shelter in Houston. We are so grateful we had a foster home for him! He shares a home with other dogs and has spent time playing at a local dog park. He plays really well with other dogs and is super friendly. The foster home has two small dogs under 30 pounds and he is great with them. He would do great in a home with another dog or would be okay without a dog. \n\nImagine Sport has a big puppy- he is a little bit awkward as he runs and moves around. He has spurts of energy (zoomies) and then crashes out for awhile. He has no idea he is not a lap dog and would love if you would hold him. He loves his stuffed animals and does not shred them as much as he likes to carry them around. He is such a happy, go lucky boy. \n\nHe has meet cats and kittens while they were in carriers at the vet office. He casually sniffed and wagged his tail. We will note, he has not been in a home with a cat, so this is the extent of our information regarding cats.  He shares a foster home with kids ages 8-14 years old and LOVES them. They also have friends who come over to visit and he is always excited to say hello. His foster mom describes him as a \"big pillow and snuggle buddy.\" \n\nSport is learning to not jump out of excitement when first meeting you. He is very smart and learns quickly. He does pull on leash and could use more work in this area. He is fully housebroken and does fine when crated. \n \nSport is looking for a home who will engage with him- this could be by having another dog or providing outlets physical outlets. He is a curious, attentive and outgoing dog. He is extremely cuddly and affectionate. He rides well in the car and enjoys going places. We hope you give this guy with a huge heart an opportunity to become a part of your family! \n\n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Venus is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nVenus proves that even older dogs have tons of spunk and life in them! Her foster describes her as one of the most energetic dogs she's met and would thrive in a home with a canine sibling. She plays with lots of dogs at the dog park and gets along with every one, all at least her weight or much larger. She keeps up with the   Bellas and Buddys, but does forget to read their cues of being done playing. \n\nVenus is leash, house and crate trained to much success. She hasn't had any issues meeting other dogs on a leash but will pull and whine to go say hello. She pulls on the leash but is easily redirected home; a Gentle Leader head collar or harness may help with leash skills in lieu of training, which is always a good idea. Venus has not had any accidents in the house and is often curled up napping when her foster is at home. She usually stays crated when unable to be supervised because she loves nothing more than re-making the bed for her foster mom, tossing pillows and blankets to and 'fro. Venus does have some separation anxiety (she pants and paces, barks and howls) when left alone so crating has been super helpful to her foster mom. \n\nVenus has not been around kids but given her energy and constant movement, she would likely do best in a home with kids over the age of 10yrs. She occasionally scratches out of playful excitement and may inadvertently knock over a young child. No matter the age, we recommend homes with kids who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. Venus is not good with cats. \n\nVenus is overall smart, playful, curious and silly. She love attention and if she doesn\u2019t get enough, she demand it in a sweet and playful manner. She loves tennis balls and ropes for tug of war, often losing herself in play and forgetting other dogs are around. She is the most cuddly and affectionate dog ever, and loves meeting new people. She treats each new person as a new friend she's just not kissed yet. She loves to jump up for cuddles and affection (if you let her), car rides, and exploring like the adventurous girl she is.\n\nShe would be perfect for someone with a backyard and children. She is not an outside dog and is most comfortable sleeping on the bed underneath the blankets. She needs a lot of attention but she will not act out if she does not get it\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

        "description": "Hi I'm Faith! They named me that because I was rescued on Thanksgiving-Eve and had my puppies the very next day. It was really cold out in the parking lot but I believed I would make it through. A Good Sam took pitty on me as I was in early labor and struggling to find a play to deliver. I had 15 pups and 12 of my babies survived.  I've now raised my babies and I have faith that I'll get my forever home soon...\n\nI'm incredibly sweet and affectionate, and I get along with other dogs. I'm also housetrained. I'm about 50 lbs and the vet said I'm about a year and a half old. \n\nFriends Fur Life Rescue found great homes for all of them (except one who is with me still waiting) and they got me to the vet so I'm in tip-top shape now! I'm spayed and my belly is nice and flat now (unlike in my profile picture lol). \n\nCan I join your family? You won't be disappointed! Please fill out my rescue's form today and my people will give you a call!\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/friendsfurlife/adoption-application\n\nThank you for reading! I'm in Texas but my rescue will send me to your city. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

Transports run every few weeks and we will have the dog on the next available transport once approved. If you are not able to accept a dog until a specific time period, please apply at that time************\n\nWe are a volunteer run rescue and donate our time to these dogs. IF you are not serious about moving forward in our adoption process, please do not apply. If someone other than yourself is part of the decision making process, please make sure you have spoken with them and they are on board. We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nMANGO is a 50 lb, 2.5 yr old, neutered Bull Terrier mix who is currently in a foster home in Houston, TX. He can be transported once his adoption is approved! \n\nMango is a fun, sweet love bug who's searching for his forever home! \nHe loves cuddles on the couch where he can put your head on your legs or chest and just snooze on you. When not sitting at your feet while you cook, Mango loves to chew, zoom around with his plush toys and chase balls around the room. His love languages are touch and quality time. \n\nMango is a medium energy dog who is very good at entertaining himself with chews. His favorite game is fetch, which he plays at expert level which includes catching, bringing back, and releasing the ball gently in your hand.  He's also a scholar and has completed obedience training. He knows \"sit,\" \"down,\" \"paw,\" and \"drop it.\"\n\nMango does not currently live in a home with other dogs but has met dogs on walks and does well. He can relax in their presence and wait patiently while the humans finish chatting and for the walk to resume. Typically, Mango ignores other dogs on walks but is certainly curious when the other dog seems excited to meet. He tends to match the other dogs' energy when he sees them on walks, but is not concerned with dogs that lunge or growl and chooses to ignore them. Otherwise, Mango is a calm walker and does not typically wander all over the place (unless the smell is REALLY good). He also keeps pace on short runs with his foster mom and seems to enjoy running with her. \n\nBecause he does not live with other dogs, Mango's play style was assessed by a trainer. He can be very excited to see other dogs and play with them off leash, and would do well slowly acclimatizing to other dogs in the home. He did well over time with gentle corrections and was better at picking up on ques as time went on while in his training assessment. \n\nMango is both crate and house trained. He currently sleeps in his crate, although we think he would love to have a home where he sleeps with you with his paws always touching, but, if not, he knows how to sleep quietly and peacefully in his crate until you let him out in the morning. He's crated when his mom is not home. He generally knows what dog toys are and doesn't try to play with household items. For exercise, he generally only asks for one walk a day and a game of fetch, but would benefit from two if you have the time. \n\nMango is fed in his crate to help create positive associations with it. He jumps for joy when his food comes out. He gobbles it up, so currently he's eating from a slow feeder. \n\nWe recommend a home with older kids for Mango, although we do not have a history with children. Currently, he sometimes likes to jump when excited, although he has shown some improvement in that regard. When he gets his zoomies, or jumps he can be boisterous and could possibly knock over small kids. He's a very gentle soul, but his excitement can get the better of him. \n\nMango would love a home where he can cuddle his humans and be showered with affection. Touch and play are his love languages and his happy tail would win anyone's heart. He has done well meeting strangers and he's been patiently waiting for the right forever home to find him. \n\n\nWe do not have a history with cats. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nJunior, 1.5yr old neutered male, Siberian Husky mix, 65 pounds. Junior is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nJunior has had a rough, unfortunate and rocky start to his short life but all that is behind him now with only brighter days ahead. He lasted an unprecedented 40 days in the city shelter before landing on the euth list so when we say Junior is one of the more chill huskies you'll ever meet, we mean it!\n\nJunior has been around dogs of his same size and bigger, from bull terriers to Danes, and he keeps up with them all. He plays rough like a puppy, boxes with his front paws, and humps when he gets the chance. He play bows and chases the dogs around the yard, and is learning when to leave the other dogs alone, although he has not yet mastered the social cues. Junior absolutely needs a playmate - he doesn't have to be the only dog or have a sibling but he needs to continue his positive socialization around other dogs, and would be great for doggy day care, play dates or parks.\n\nJunior does pretty well on a leash and absolutely loves going for walks. He knows the word and gets excited when he sees the leash come out. He starts out wiggly and pulls a bit when excited but it is nothing out of the ordinary and that training cannot fix. \n\nJunior has seen cats while on walks and doesn't seem to want to chase them but we do not have enough history to say whether he is cat friendly. He's encountered kids in the neighborhood playing on the other side of the fence and is very interested in saying hello. We think he'd be best suited for a family with older kids simply because he is still a puppy himself and likes to jump or slap with his paws. \n \nAs a young man, Junior still needs to improve on a few things - he jumps, throws paws, counter surfs, and is a Grade A beggar. Even still, he knows sit and a few other commands, and is a quick learner. He's extremely well behaved in his kennel and is quiet except when he needs to go out to potty. He's fully house trained and hasn't had any accidents in the house. \n\nJunior is fed separate from the other dogs in the home as a general rule of his foster. He's not shown any signs of resource guarding or food aggression, and happily shares his treats and toys. He loves going to the toy bin and finding a new/different toy to shake the stuffing out of or toss about. Junior is still a pup and full of that youthful energy but he settles well, lying on the  floor next to you or entertaining himself with a toy.\n\nHis foster describes Junior as shy and clingy, but says he's working on his confidence. He is slow to warm up but once he's gotten use to you, he is super cuddly and affectionate, and has no sense of personal space. He makes coming home at the end of the day the best experience ever, as he is giddy and bursting with silly, goofy delight to see you.\n\nJunior's ideal home would be a single individual or older couple who will make him the center of their world, babying him and taking him on adventures. He is slow to warm up to men and does not like people sneaking up from behind him or moving too quickly, nor does he take well to harsh/strong correction - it all scares him too much. Junior is very loving and loyal to his people and he relies on his family to make him secure if he is unsure. He is a Velcro pup and bonds tightly. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

        "description": "******Please note, once completing the initial screen you will be connected with the placement for a video chat. Transports run every few weeks and we will have the dog on the next available transport once approved. If you are not able to accept a dog until a specific time period, please apply at that time************\n\nWe are a volunteer run rescue and donate our time to these dogs. IF you are not serious about moving forward in our adoption process, please do not apply. If someone other than yourself is part of the decision-making process, please make sure you have spoken with them and they are on board. We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nMaggie May, 5 years old, spayed female, Pitbull/Catahoula mix, 50 pounds. She is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport to an approved adopter. Please note, she is physically located in the State of Texas. \n\nMaggie May was a volunteer favorite at the city shelter where she was saved off the euthanasia list and it is clear to see why - she is incredibly sweet and strikingly good looking! \n\nBefore you think she is only just a beauty, she's got the brains and brawn to go with it. Maggie knows several commands including \"sit,\" \"down,\" \"stay,\" \"break (go),\" \"touch\" and \"heel.\" She also helps get rid of any Amazon boxes to ensure continued marital bliss. :)\n\nShe is fully house- and crate-trained but could use some additional leash training as she tends to pull - a harness or Gentle Leader head collar would be great tools here. She loves playing fetch and will do just about anything you want for a toy, so training has been made much simpler! With a toy nearby, Maggie will even allow you to clip and file down her nails with zero fuss.\n\nMaggie May is dog friendly but is confident enough on her own to not require a companion and would actually really love having your attention all to herself.  She has met other dogs and is very excited when first meeting but does well. She gets quite vocal when being introduced to dogs - lots of grunts and whimpers and scurrying about - and some dogs may not like this overexuberance, so proper introductions should be conducted to ensure all goes well. We have found dog parks are too overstimulating for her. \n\nShe is a solid moderate energy dog: she needs no more than a couple walks a day and she really loves them. She would love a home where she can go on sniff walks, play fetch or tug-o-war, \"brain\" games, or obedience training to satisfy her mental needs. Given her love of toys and fetch, Maggie could also excel at a sport or agility training! She is not bouncing off the walls but also isn't a total couch potato. When she is lounging on the couch, expect to see a toy or two (or all!) nearby. \n\nMaggie May has a touch of separation anxiety but it is not destructive or extreme - she whimpers as a form of self-soothing when her person is not nearby. She also paces around and nests her blankets but has never chewed up or eaten anything she shouldn't. As a general household rule, she is crated for meals and when unable to be supervised but can sleep loose in her room or with you. She has great house manners - she does not \"over\" bark and will alert only when startled or if someone comes to the door, she pays no mind to the vacuum and does not get into the trash.\n\nWe have no history with cats although she will see them while out walking and does not pay them any mind. She has met kids aged 2-4 years old and she LOVES them but has knocked them over with her tail wags. We typically recommend homes with kids 10 years or older, or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues.\n\nMaggie May is very affectionate with people and greets everyone as though they were a long-lost friend. She gives nose kisses and the occasional lick but finds being close enough to touch (but not actually touching) is sufficient for her needs. Maggie May is very loyal and has a strong desire to please her human. She rides well in the car and loves going on adventures (grabbing coffee) with her person. She can be possessive of her toys so these should be kept separate from other animals in the house. She would do best in a home willing to provide structure and boundaries as she thrives falling into line.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nInterested in applying to adopt her?

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nTalula, 4-year-old, spayed female, pitbull mix, 55 pounds. Talula is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nTalula had a home, she had a mom, a two-legged sister and a kitty sibling but all that was lost when her family fell on hard times, and she ended up hit by a car and at the SPCA. We had hoped she would be able to return to her family but unfortunately, things did not end up that way and this sweet, perfect girl is back to looking for her furever home.\n\nTalula is incredibly dog friendly - she lives in a foster home with 6 other dogs ranging from a 10lb chihuahua to a 106lb cane corso/pittie mix. She gets along with the males, females, old and young, bigs and smalls alike. Her play style is very playful and submissive - she enjoys chasing her foster sister around the back yard, rolls on her back when wrestling before swapping roles, and just having a grand ol' time.\n\nTalula is fully house trained and knows how to use a doggy door. Even when first in her foster home, Talula never had an accident and adapted quickly to the routine of the house. She loves her crate and will often take a break from the chaos by napping or putting herself to bed. She enjoys taking her meals in her kennel and is a true gentlewoman, quiet as a church mouse when crated. Her foster works from home so she isn't usually kenneled for long, but she has been crated on occasion up to 9hrs.\n\nTalula is a fantastic house guest and is not destructive - she is totally fine to be left alone unsupervised and has yet to get into anything she shouldn't. She enjoys the opportunity to sleep loose (sometimes she doesn't want to, instead choosing her kennel) and is a perfect bed-guest too. She finds a spot near the foot of the bed and stays there.\n\nTalula walks well on a leash and is non-reactive when encountering other dogs or strangers; she rides well in a car; and of course, enjoys plushy toys or snack time. Her only \"flaws\" appear to be a penchant for digging holes and immediately rolling around in the freshly tilled dirt; being an epic snorer; and being timid around men. She still barks at her foster dad and brother-in-law, even after living with them for nearly two months. She will make pains to avoid going by them, taking the long way around to the back door or waiting to enter the house until they've moved on. \n\nOverall, Talula is docile and so even keeled that it speaks volumes of the hardships her adoptive home must have been going through that they would not come back for her. We would love for her next chapter to be the last time she is unsettled. She is the most cuddly, sweet and affectionate girl there is, and she deserves a home that is willing to reciprocate that love. She doesn't need an overly active house - a backyard to run around in or a couple walks a day are plenty to satisfy her physical demands. She would love having a sibling of the two- and four-legged variety, or plenty of opportunities for doggy day care, play dates, or the dog park to socialize.\n\nTalula has lived with toddlers and cats before but does not currently live with either. In general, we recommend homes with kids over the age of 10yrs or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Due to his wiggly body, we recommend a home with kids 12 years and older. \n\nSunny walks well on leash. When he sees another dog he will pull because he wants to say hi. He is easy to redirect. For the most part he walks a little in front with little pulling. He is housebroken. He enjoys being his crate with the door open. \n\nHe is food motivated. He loves to chew on toys and bones. We would describe him as moderate energy. His current foster takes him on a walk daily and he really enjoys the exercise. \n\nHe is very smart and eager to please.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\n\nStar, 8 months old (estimated DOB August 2023), spayed female, Retriever/Dane mix, currently weighs 50 pounds, expected to be a large size when full grown. She is physically located in a foster home in San Antonio, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved. \n\nWe saw someone post about Star and her friend after they were picked up by Animal Control and taken to the county shelter. Their owner had been without a home and was arrested which led to them being picked up. Due to overcrowding, Star was scheduled for euthanasia. We are thankful a foster home came forward to save her precious life. \n\nSince being in foster care, Star has mastered crate training. She goes in her crate and is pretty quiet overall. She is fully housebroken and walks really well on leash. \n\nStar is a typical puppy with that zest for life and curious view of the world. She is walking well on leash. She is very friendly and greets everyone with a tail wag. She will jump up in a friendly manner which her foster mom has been working on. She would greatly benefit from a home who will invest energy into providing her a foundation, consistency and lots of love. \n\nShe has been in a home with a cat. She has tried to make friends by running after him. We think she is eager to make friends. If you have a cat who can set boundaries with a dog, we think she would do great. \n\nStar shares a home with an older dog. She has learned to respect boundaries and picks up on ques. She has met other dogs outside of the house and brings all of that fun puppy energy. She loves to play, chase and run around. We think she would do wonderful with a dog who wants to play. She would do okay as an only dog with ways to socialize her with other dogs. She has discovered toys and really likes dismantling the squeakers. \n\nWe have no history with kids and recommend a home with kids who respect and understand animal boundaries. \n\nStar is eager to learn and please. She rides well in the car and loves to be around people. For puppies this age, someone needs to be home more than they are away. We would like to see another dog in the home to continue her healthy socialization with other dogs. \n\nStar's foster mom tells us that she really is such a lover. She has wonderful house manners. She will run and have zoomies in the backyard. She rides well in the car and is so excited about life. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

If someone other than yourself is part of the decision making process, please make sure you have spoken with them and they are on board. We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nMEET BEAUTIFUL BELLA!\n\nBella is a 10mo old (born June 2023) spayed female black labrador, weighing 54 lbs, and currently is in a foster home in HOUSTON TX. She can be transported out of state to an approved adopter. \n\nBella's rescue story is unlike many others: a family found a wandering loose dog in their neighborhood and took her in...only to soon find out she was pregnant. That pregnant mama gave birth to THIRTEEN puppies and this amazing family did their very best to give all 14 dogs what they needed - physically, mentally and emotionally. Thankfully, the family reached out to rescues and we were able to intake several, splitting the puppies amongst a few local rescues.\n\nBella was raised with her 12 siblings and absolutely adores playing with other dogs. She knows when other dogs want to stop playing, doesn't have issues with high energy dogs, and lights up when she has doggy playmates. Another dog in the home would be great to help grow confidence and bring her out of her shell. She's still learning how to play with other dogs - she can play a little rough, but has started laying down and pawing the other dog to get her to play. \n\nBella is very puppy-like: she likes to chase balls and toys when you throw them for her (and will sometimes bring them back). She takes off for the toys running and bouncing, leaping the whole way to the toy and when she gets to it, she bats at it like she's a cat. It's really funny to see!\n\nBella is excellent in the home. She's still young so she's had the occasional accident, but she gets the hang of a routine quickly and her foster has noted a significant improvement. Bella is crate trained and does really, really well - she takes her meals and sleeps in the kennel, and has spent up to 8hrs crated while her foster is at work. She takes comfort in her \"room\" and will go to the crate when you tell her without a single bit of fuss.\n\nBella does need a bit of work on the leash but overall has good manners, such that her mom has been able to take her for runs. She does best with some slack on the leash and may benefit from a Gentle Leader head collar or a \"no pull\" harness, especially if there is a good smell to be sniffed. Bella is curious when she sees another dog when she is on a leash - she notices them and acts like she wants to play. \n\nShe's an active young lady and overall sweet, curious and silly just as you'd expect. She'd love a yard at her new home to run around, and would love to ride in your car for a trip to the park. She does great in the car, curling up and snoozing until she's reached her destination.\n\nOnce she is comfortable with you, she loves to get attention and follow you around the house, but is not stuck to you. She can be timid at first but warms up and is quite cuddly and affectionate, she likes to give kisses and be around people.  She is very sweet and loving! \n\nAn ideal home for Bella has doggy siblings and an active life style. She would love to spend the rest of her days getting lots of love from her family and playing in a yard with other dogs. Bella would love a patient adoptive home that is willing to help her navigate this big world and have lots of fun along the way. \n\nShe does well with gentle correction and redirection, but is still young and learning new interactions with people. She does best with meeting strangers outside of the house before they come inside where she feels safe. We suggest a home with older children that will respect her boundaries when she communicates her discomfort. She has been in a home with a child as young as 10 yrs and did well. We have no history with cats.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nLilly, 6.5 years old, spayed female, plot hound/pitbull Terrier mix, 65 pounds. She is located in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport out of State to an approved adopter. You will be connected to her foster home for a video chat once screened. \n\nLilly is the goofiest, silliest, sweetest and most deserving girl there is in all the land. Every thing is a new experience for her and even if it isn\u2019t, she makes you feel like it is because she\u2019s just that grateful to be with you. She is magnetic and is hard to forget, and is just so happy.\n\nShe rides like a champ in the car, laying back and snoozing until arriving at her destination.  She\u2019s potty trained and only had a few accidents in the house, mostly a result of nerves from being in a new place and having too much fun playing outside with her doggy foster siblings.  Once she got a hang of our routine and figured out the doggy door, she never had another accident. \n\nShe is not food or toy aggressive and can happily roam free in the house, keeping out of anything she shouldn\u2019t get into.  She is crate trained but knows well how to bust out of them!  She likes grazing on her food throughout the day and will occasionally shred a plushy toy, but who\u2019s never done that before??\n\nShe loves simple things: a spoon of peanut butter, ice, frozen watermelon, hiding under the bed to sleep, a soft doggy bed, COUCH TIME, and oh does she love sleeping in the bed with you! She doesn\u2019t love baths but she loves how she feels afterward, so she resigns herself to that necessary evil.  She snores and snorts, grunts and groans, and bugs her eyes out.  She\u2019s quite the character and we love having her in the house.  \n\nShe is not afraid of men or children, other dogs, loud (she sleeps through the vacuum) or strange noises.  She rarely barks.  She\u2019s a good low/moderate level energy - she likes to play and can definitely have spurts of energy but once given the chance to work the zoomies out, she is most content to sleep away the day.  \n\nShe got along well with the four dogs - all large males. Initially we noticed some barrier reactivity while she was in her crate but this was resolved by moving her to a private room and then slowly introducing her to the dogs in the house.  She did great! She doesn\u2019t like dogs getting up in her face and will grumble or growl but she never initiated a squabble.  She will engage in play or she will just follow her friends around and things out. We think she do great with another dog or would be great by herself. She really loves the company of her people. \n\nWe would not recommend her for any house with very young children or people unsteady on their feet - she\u2019s still learning some basic manners and will often run at you before using your chest as a springboard to twirl in the air - basically, she\u2019s Simone Biles! We have no history with cats.\n\nLilly deserves all the good things because she herself is a good thing...she has a lot to make up for and she is eager to get going! If you haven't already fallen in love with her, wait until you see her potbelly...it's legendary. :)\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Transports run every few weeks and we will have the dog on the next available transport once approved. If you are not able to accept a dog until a specific time period, please apply at that time************\n\nWe are a volunteer run rescue and donate our time to these dogs. IF you are not serious about moving forward in our adoption process, please do not apply. If someone other than yourself is part of the decision making process, please make sure you have spoken with them and they are on board. We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nFreddie, 5 years old, neutered male, Pitbull/lab mix, 53 pounds. Freddie is in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved. You will have an opportunity to video chat to \"meet\" him virtually. \n\nFreddie has dashingly handsome good looks and a set of button ears any show dog would kill for. When he hears something interesting, he tilts his head and looks at you with these wide soft brown eyes. He has a gorgeous smile and a set of 8-pack abs that will make you giggle and then run to the gym to get your own. Our most favorite thing about him, though, are a series of cowlicks which line his chest, lower waist and butt cheeks. You could get lost in those swirls.\n\nFreddie is a naturally inquisitive and inherently brave boy who just isn\u2019t fully confident he can do all of the things he wants to attempt, so he looks to his person for reassurance and to calm his nerves. While we have no history\nof his life as a pup or before he came to the shelter, we believe the cause for his anxiety really rests in under-socialization. When exposed to new things, places and people, Freddie can be nervous but he wants to push through and just needs the encouragement to do so. Freddie has come so far since being rescued last year and placed into foster care, and he continues to improve every day.\n\nHe is a perfect gentleman on a leash, is crate and house trained, and people and dog friendly - although he can be stiff when meeting large dogs. He would do best with dogs who are submissive or willing to be submissive, as this stiffness can come read like he is trying to assert himself (which he isn't). He would not do well with a dog who is in your face hyper, that's just too much for him.\n\nFreddie likes to go on walks and loves any sort of hard, chew toy. He gets extremely playful when given the opportunity to play with squishy toys, thrashing his head, galloping and whining. He loves to play tug-of-war and likes water bottles filled with rocks - he\u2019s a man of simple pleasures. He can be mischievous around wayward shoes or soft fluffy items, but that seems to be a crime of convenience.\n\nFreddie absolutely loves routine and structure, and would be best served by someone who will allow him a week or two to acclimate to his new environment, and to settle in and learn the ropes. With consistency, Freddie bonds tightly to his person and seeks out their company. He appreciates knowing when and who will let him out, feed him, and give him the love he so desperately deserves. He will often put himself to bed when he is overstimulated and needs a break.\n\nHis normal day includes a half/mile walk morning and night with a few potty breaks in between as able, and a healthy dose of one-on-one time for affection and some exposure training. He has gone 10hrs between potty breaks without incident. Freddie has only had one accident throughout his time with us and that was when he first came here. Outside of that, Freddie has not had an accident in the house.\n\nHe makes an excellent couch partner with current TV favorites being any of the British Bake Off series, dramas, or legal thrillers. Freddie loves listening to soothing music at night and would be an excellent companion for a single or older person who has the ability to shower him with time and attention. His energy level is best described as low to moderate, as he doesn\u2019t need very long walks to get his energy out, and he\u2019s not bouncing off the walls if he doesn\u2019t get those walks. \n\nHe can be a jumper so we would recommend children over the age of 10.\nHe can absolutely be an only dog, although he\u2019d thrive in a home with other canine companions. When Freddy sees other dogs, he gets very excited and likes to bark and play bow at them through the barrier.\n\nIn the time he has been in our house as a foster, Freddie has learned to be in a crate during the day and occasionally at night, and to ignore loud or scary sounds like lawnmowers, buses, etc. Freddy\u2019s anxiety manifests itself as licking, heavy panting, and the occasional whimpering; he is not destructive to house or home. He knows basic commands and is extremely food motivated, so additional training should be easy and would really help him have a positive outlet for his anxiety. We\u2019ve found calming chews, soft music at night, positive reinforcement,\nand a set schedule are the tools Freddie requires to be the brave boy he is.\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nGus, 2yr old neutered male, pit bull mix, 75 pounds. Gus is in a foster home in San Antonio, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nGus is a friendly, happy and wiggly little piggy who enjoys running around the backyard or going on walks. He is still a young guy and would make an incredible adventure buddy for an active, on-the-go type of home. His most favorite thing in the world is water and he would be ever so thrilled to have a pool, lake or boat of his own to be closer to it.\n\nGus has been fostered in a home with other dogs and does best with one who is well balanced. He can be very forward in his playstyle so a dog who is neutral would be best suited, as his eagerness can tip the scales otherwise. He likes wrestling and running around with other dogs, and prefers an active canine sibling to a layabout. He does not have to be the only dog but would certainly welcome being the center of your world if you deemed it necessary.\n\nGus does not currently - but did formerly - live with younger kids, aged 2-8yrs and did well overall but due to his energy and occasional habit of jumping and being a bit mouthy, we would recommend a home with kids over the age of 10yrs. No matter the age, we generally recommend a home with kids who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. We have no direct history with cats but his foster notes he seems to ignore them while on walks.\n\nAs a young lad, Gus needs some improvement on his leash skills as he does tend to pull and will get overly excited when another dog comes into his line of vision. We have found a \"no pull\" harness or Gentle Leader head collar work well to limit his pulling and thankfully, he generally sticks to one side while walking. He finds himself one with nature on walks and will chase butterflies or follow bugs crawling along the sidewalk.\n\nGus is very smart and trainable, and is fully house and crate trained. He has been allowed to stay loose in the house while unsupervised for short periods of time but is overall crated when no one is home. He's very calm and peaceful in his kennel, and enjoys eating his meals in there.\n\nWhen he gets too excited, Gus will jump up and play bite but his fosters have been correcting this by ignoring him or ending play until he settles down. He is easily redirectable and his foster says does best with a toy in his mouth while getting pets. Unsurprisingly, he's often found with a ball in his mouth - ready in case you want to play a quick game of fetch...his second favorite activity.\n\nGus absolutely loves people and play time. He's friendly but not overly cuddly and enjoys sitting on the couch with his head on the pillow. He does fantastic when meeting new people and takes treats very gently. His ideal home would be with someone willing to invest time in basic obedience and who will provide structure and routine, he needs a positive outlet for his moderate energy or he will get bored. He enjoys a squeaky toy or benebone, chasing the water hose with a high pitched bark before retreating inside to nap on the couch. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Major is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nMajor and his two brothers were saved from an overcrowded shelter in San Antonio. They have been residing in the same foster home. One of the brothers has been adopted and Major is patiently waiting his turn! \n\nSmart Major- Major is good-natured and sweet. He is the most easy going and mellow of the trio. He matches the energy of other dogs, so if they want to romp around he's happy to do so. If not, he will just quietly walk around.  He has had some playtime with a Shitzu puppy and was very sweet with her. He would play bow and roll around on the floor to be at her level. \n\nHe is SMART- he picked up on \"sit\" within minutes and has \"stay\" and \"no speak\" almost down. He's very intuitive and seems to really understand what you want from him when he's in a focused mood. He is very treat motivated for training. He is very loyal and will occasionally lean against your leg for some pets before running off to play more. \n\nHe lives in a foster home with cats but we're not sure if he's cat friendly just yet. He barks and wants to chase the cats when he sees them, and the cats run away before they actually encounter one another. The cats and Major are kept separated by baby gates.\n\nMajor also shares a home with a 9 year old child and LOVES her. They have become good friends.  He has a great temperament and seems very intuitive about his size and appropriate behavior. We think he would do great around any ages of children. We always recommend a home with kids who understand and respect animal boundaries. \n\nMajor likes to be in front and will sometimes pull on leash.  He likes to sniff things and explore, so often will cross in front, go around or behind, step down into the street or pull. He is crate trained and house broken.  \n\nMajor is a good-natured sweetheart. He loves balls and his Kong treat toy, especially when filled with peanut butter.  He is VERY loyal, intuitive and smart and loves tummy rubs ?\n\nMajor would thrive in an active home. He loves to go on walks and we think with some guidance would make a really great running buddy. His forever home would be understanding he is a young dog who needs structure and consistency.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nSnowy Sasha, 8 month old, spayed female pit bull mix, 48pounds. Snowy is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nFrom what her rescuers know of Snowy\u2019s existence \u2013 Snowy spent most of her young life on a short chain wearing a heavy leather harness without socialization. Snowy is catching up on so many puppy experiences and critical life stages she was robbed of while being isolated at such a young age. All considered, Snowy is doing well with learning how to be a part of a pack, trust humans and live indoors.\n\nSnowy Sasha plays vigorously (hard), she enjoys playing chase & tackle and tug of war with her foster siblings, and will herd her siblings biting and chewing at their feet during play.  Snowy plays with dogs of all sizes (large, medium, and small while in her foster home ranging from an 80 lb. Staffordshire Terrier, 45lb Black mouth Cur, 30 lb. Shepard mix to a 12 lb. Chiweenie) and is learning how to be a part of a pack. She is learning to pick up and read cues from her playmates and when to playing. \n\nAs she's had nearly no socialization to date, Snowy requires slow, supervised introductions but once she is introduced properly, she is comfortable and will play well with other dogs. Snowy does fine on a leash - she's not all over the place, walks calmly, and pulls only a moderate bit. Her foster mom is working on her leash skills, so she has not had a great deal of exposure to other dogs who are on a leash in public settings but notes that Snowy becomes reactive when she sees other dogs on a leash, barking loudly. \n\nWe have not introduced her to cats yet, but she has met older kids (12-16 years old) with no issues at all. Based on her energy level, we believe she would be okay with small children. It is important no matter how old the kids in a home are that they understand and respect animal behavior cues.  \n\nSnowy is house broken and her foster is working to train her to alert using door bells. She is crated when unable to be supervised and while sleeping at night. When her foster is home working, Snowy is left unattended in the kitchen and does fine with \u201cpuppy-proofing\u201d of the room since she's still in that puppy exploring/chewing phase. \n\nSnowy has displayed some resource guarding around food, treats and bones so she does best when fed separately in her kennel or a different room. When her fellow foster pup attempts to take her antler or cow hoof while she is actively chewing on it, she will show her teeth and give a low growl.\n\nA moderately active home would suit her energy level. Snowy plays vigorously with other dogs and enjoys a good daily walk but calms down easily and naps throughout the day. Snowy\u2019s peak playful times are when she wakes up early in the morning and evening before bed. She looooves to play with stuffed toys with squeakers in them and playing tug with the other dogs, especially the bungie rope toy hung in her backyard. \n\nShe will benefit from another dog of similar size, age and energy level to play with or regular exposure to a play group (doggy day care) to continue her positive socialization. Being around humans is new to Snowy, she's learning how to trust and once she feels comfortable, she's very affectionate and eager to please. She enjoys showing and receiving affection and being near her humans. Gentle encouragement go a long way for Snowy when meeting strangers and she would love a patient, understanding and reassuring adopter to call Mom/Dad.\n\nSnowy is a \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d who will thrive in a home with forever parents who are patient and willing to continue train her. Forever parents who are experienced dog owners, even Staffie/Pittie breed experience with a familiarity of the breed quirks.\n\nSlow introductions take place over one to two weeks at least. The first week, the new pet should be contained to a separate room in a kennel and given time to decompress. Once acclimated to their new environment, the pets are allowed to pass by one another's kennels and watched for reaction. After another day or two of successful kennel passes, the pets can begin meeting on opposite sides of a baby gate or other barrier before progressing to supervised and leashed interactions. Assuming all has gone smoothly to this point, pets can be allowed off leash to interact. Another great way to \"slow\" intro a dog is through parallel walks on opposite sides of a street or with one dog far ahead of the other, slowly meeting until side-by-side. It is important potential adopters give their new family member time to adjust, as it is a big change for these pets.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nInterested in applying to adopt her?

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nRoux, 2yr old spayed female, pitbull mix, 53 pounds. Roux is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nRoux is an excitable, energetic gal who loves to play hard. She likes to chase and herd her canine friends, nipping at their legs and neck when excited. She lives in a foster home with a large breed dog and would do best with another dog of her same size and energy level/play style. An older or smaller dog would not be the ideal match for this young spitfire. \n\nRoux is mostly non-reactive toward other dogs but will bark and pull toward them when encountered on her walks - she's super eager to go say hi and play, but she does not bark nor is she aggressive in her excitement. She has decent leash manners but when she catches a scent she wants to see through, Roux can pull rather hard. Her foster is working with her and in general, we find harnesses or Gentle Leader head collars to work well at controlling unwanted leash behaviors.\n\nRoux has been around younger kids at her neighborhood park but does not spend much time nor does she live with them. She behaved sweetly with a toddler who approached her in the park but since she's an eager beaver, we would recommend an adoptive home with kids over the age of 8yrs. \n\nRoux is cat friendly...to an extent. She lives in a foster home with cats and enjoys the company of the youngest cat, sleeping nearby when they are both settled. Like any older sister, though, when Roux gets overstimulated and she sees him move - she does like to chase after him. She's more curious than anything but her foster notes it depends a lot on her energy level at the time.\n\nRoux is working on her house manners: learning to settle and what an acceptable inside energy level is, and perfecting her potty training. She drinks a lot of water (gotta stay hydrated with all that play!) so she does pee a lot and is let out every 2-3 hours when her foster is home. Nevertheless, Roux has had a few accidents in the house.\n\nShe is crated during the day and has never had an accident in the crate. She\u2019s ok in the crate but will cry in the mornings when she hears that people are up. She has serious FOMO. She always wants to be inside or out of the crate with her people. She is always crated when unsupervised as she finds things to destroy. Puppy behavior.\n\nRoux has not demonstrated any food aggression or resource guarding, but she does enjoy stealing her foster sibling's toys and is an avid toy destroyer. Roux LOVES to play. She\u2019ll fetch, tug, and likes chew bones. She is very sweet and cuddly and tries to sit in your lap. \n\nRoux would be happiest in a home with active people or people that would work her - long walks/runs, hikes, sniff spots, doggy day care or parks, and even obedience or agility training. She can jump and is very strong, and she has a herding drive that can be fun if used correctly. She\u2019d appreciate a similar energy level dog companion but would be fine as an only dog as long as the owners were active. She enjoys being busy and is curious to always be on the lookout for something to get into. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Charley is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an adopter is approved! \n\nHe's a really amiable guy and has been in playgroups of up to 4 dogs, male and female with much success. He responds well to dogs when initially meeting them, very curious and enthusiastic to be friends. Charley is very enthusiastic about playing with the dogs and is always down for a romp. He has a lot of energy when he plays, and he enjoys going to the apartment complex's dog park for larger dogs. \n\nCharley doesn't have a prey drive so he may be okay with cats or small animals but we do not have any history or previous experiences with him meeting cats. Charley has been around kids and would be best for a home with kids over the age of 12yrs. He's energetic and may inadvertently knock over a small toddler but dreams of having a two-legged sibling to chase him around or take him on walks.\n\nCharley lives in an apartment and has been a model guest since arriving - he's not climbed on furniture, broken or chewed anything he shouldn't, and is house and crate trained. His foster works away from home and he is content by himself for 7hrs or more per day, but he does get antsy when his foster leaves his line of sight, pacing and whining until he comes back. \n\nCharley may take a couple weeks to settle into a routine but once he's established the gameplan and where he falls in line, he will exceed expectations. He is very food motivated so training is made that much simpler! He also responds very well to gentle correction and excels with stability & routine. Short \"time outs\" and the leash are high value corrections for him - he doesn't need a strong hand to make an impression.\n\nCharley goes on frequent walks to get out his energy and is a gentleman on the leash but will get excited and pull towards other dogs that pass by. He is moderate to high energy (a 5-6 out of 10) and thrives with extra play time once or so a day. He would love to join in on adventures, whether that be running, walking, hikes or car rides - he is ready! \n\nThrough it all, Charley does relax in the house and loves to cuddle, he's very sweet and affectionate. He is an overall happy dog who seeks attention and love - he's good natured and goofy, even a bit clumsy! He loves to ride in the car and just wants to be with his people. Charley *loves* nylabones, pig ears/bully sticks or cheese. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

He has a playful energy level and loves to romp around with his toys. \n\nTheodore does well with other dogs! He has a zealous play style and sometimes can be a little too much for some dogs. He often tries to engage is foster sibling in play. He does well with dogs of various sizes. He would love to have a doggy sibling to play with but would do fine in a home on his own. No food aggression has been observed with either humans or other dogs. \n\nTheodore enjoys playing with toys and sometimes can mistake a household item for his own. He does well when redirected from the item. He has had a few accidents in the home, but is doing better in his training. Theodore is crated at night and when alone, and does well in the crate. When on leash, Theodore does not react to other dogs or people and walks calmly next to his foster mom. Sometimes he likes to take breaks on walks, so he doesn't need a daily adventure. Just a stroll or two a day is sufficient for this guy!\n\nWe believe that Theodore's small to medium size and calm temperament make him ideal for homes with children of many ages.

She has a silly habit of chomping at the air when she's feeling goofy and it's quite endearing, as if she needed any more charm!\n\nShe has never shown any signs of aggression or standoffishness while in foster care to humans or dogs alike. She is playful but can be mellow and a couch potato, and she LOVES to follow you around. She's a built in best friend and guide for navigating your own house!\n\nShe loves toys and will bring one to you when you come home from work, proud of all the things she now gets to call her own. She is a people pleaser and thrives on praise and affection.\n\nWe have no history with small dogs, cats or kids but generally do not expect there to be any issues with her behavior. As a standard rule, we recommend homes with kids over the age of 10yrs or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues.\n\nPenelope is getting better on her leash when going for walks. She loves a schedule and is fed in her kennel and let her out when the resident dog is done eating. Penelope is a great environmental steward and always makes sure that her foster sister ate all her food! She is crate trained and potty trained. \n\nShe would do best in a home with another dog that has the same energy as her. Penelope could also be an only dog if her adopters enjoy taking time to play with her and spend time with her. She would do best with a yard so she can run around as she loves to show you her zoomies. \n\nPenelope is the sweetest dog and deserves a home where she could be for the rest of her days! Her name definitely suits her sweet personality. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nKrayola is a spayed female, weights 42 lbs, and is a 1 YR old, Lab/Staffordshire mix who is currently in a foster home in Houston, TX. She can be transported to an approved adopter. \n\nMEET KRAYOLA\n\nKrayola will bring color into your life! She's an affectionate girl with lots of playful energy who is looking for her next big adventure. She loves the outdoors and she's active so a home that can provide the excitement she's craving would be best. She loves new people and doesn't know a stranger. \n\nIn the home, Krayola is a loyal, fun girl. She loves to play with plushies and chew on bones. She's crated when her foster family is not home and at night and does well. She's young so she's had a few accidents in the short time she's been in the foster home but she's working on it! She loves to cuddle her foster family after a good game of chase in the yard. She's also learning tricks like sitting and waiting for her meals. \n\nKrayola is very dog friendly and is always looking to play. She would love a doggy sibling to play with. She's always trying to entice the dogs in the home but they are disinterested. The other dogs in the home are 10 and 40 lbs and she's friendly with both and can pick up when they don't want to play. Krayola wants a friend! She has shown no aggression with other dogs. She is fed separately as a rule, but hasn't shown aggression around toys, bones, or treats. On leash, she loves seeing other dogs and people but doesn't bark as they pass. She can pull a bit when she smells something good but also can walk calmly on walks. \n\nKrayola has not been around cats or children. We think a home with older children would be best as she's very rambunctious and thinks everyone plays with her same enthusiasm. So, she may knock over younger kids when she's excited.\n\nAn ideal home for Krayola would be an active one where her family is excited to engage with her, continue her training and play. She'd love a doggy sibling or two. Krayola is the new adventure pup you've been waiting for! \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nArrielle, 2 years old, spayed female, pitbull mix, 35 pounds. Arrielle is in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nArrielle was saved from the local high kill shelter in Houston and is now ready to be part of your world! She has not met many dogs in her home since she's still in quarantine but in the brief, supervised interactions she's had, she has not shown any signs of concern. That said, Arrielle does tend to favor some dogs more than others, and would do best with slow, proper introductions.\n\nSlow introductions look like a week or two separated from other dogs in the home, followed by interactions through a barrier (kennel, x-pen, baby gate), then supervised encounters while on a leash, and finally loose co-mingling. This process may take one to two weeks, maybe more. Another great tactic to ensure proper introductions are walks in a neutral space at a distance before slowing bringing the dogs closer and closer together until they're side by side.\n\nWe have no history with cats or children, and based upon her behavior thus far, would recommend homes with older children. As a general rule, we typically recommend homes with kids over the age of 10yrs, or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. \n\nArrielle has impeccable house manners and is fully house broken, crate trained and fantastic on a leash. She walks calmly next to you and doesn't pull unless something catches her attention. Gentle redirection works wonders with this gal, and she quickly gets back on track. She is very comfortable in her kennel and feels safe in there, taking her meals and treats in the crate. She has not yet been trusted loose in the house while unsupervised but her foster doesn't think this would be an issue because she's yet to show any signs of anxiety or destructive nature.\n\nArrielle is a moderate energy girl and does not require an active home. She is easy going and loves to follow your lead. Normal short walks and showing her love and affection are all she needs to be set for life. She lives for one-on-one attention and enjoys chewing on a bone while curled up next to you. Arrielle thrives on routine - she enjoys knowing her meals are at a set time, walks are consistent, and the structure that comes with a workday.\n\nShe can be a bit apprehensive when meeting a new person, barking a bit but with slow introductions, she warms up and will approach for pets and cuddles. Once she has latched on to you, she is a very sweet, highly affectionate girl who loves pets and is quite treat motivated. She's remarkably intelligent and highly trainable. She is looking for direction and loves to show you that she is capable of achieving the given task. She will sit for treats and listens to verbal cues. Overall, she is an amazing and well-balanced sweet girl.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nInterested in applying to adopt her?

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nSheya, 1.5 year old, spayed female, German Shepherd mix, 50 pounds. Sheya is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nSheya is a queen and commands respect but is willing to give it back too. She has been around many other dogs ranging in size from extra large - Anatolian and German Shepherd males, to large Rottweiler females, and those in between. She makes herself known and can play rough, but does not always pick up on cues from the other dogs. Overall though, she and her foster siblings play well together, watching and chasing squirrels, and other \"assigned jobs.\" With males in particular, Sheya falls into a pack role with ease.\n\nWe have no history with cats, but Sheya has been around older children (aged 8 and 15) with success. She does still nip and can be bossy, so we would advise homes with kids over the age of 10yrs, or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. \n\nSheya has a guard mentality and takes her job seriously, protecting her own in their space. When outsiders dare intrude on her turf, she is the world's best alarm system. She does best meeting new people outside the home or in slow doses with her person around to assure her it is okay. Once she has grown accustomed to you, Sheya is a lovey dovey cuddle machine and enjoys close proximity to you. She loves to the end of the earth and bonds tightly.\n\nSheya is higher energy than she is couch potato and is quite athletic. In her first foster home, she would go on 3+ mile walks several times a day and now, she has the run of a large backyard and active foster siblings to chase her about. She knows how to jump over crates or gates.\n\nSheya is nearly fully house trained and may have accidents while adjusting to a new routine. She does alert when she needs to go outside but she does best on a strict schedule of breaks. Sheya's current routine is an early morning potty as soon as she wakes up, a break in the mid-day and again after her pawrents get home from work; about an hour after dinner, she is let back outside to potty and roam before a final break before bed.\n\nSheya is crate trained and will go in willingly, although she is trusted to be left loose in her own space. She sleeps loose on a doggy bed and has not been destructive. Sheya knows manners - she sits when you tell her to and is learning to wait for food, not jump, and to settle down. She's learned the commands \"easy\" and \"calm down.\" She is incredibly intelligent and listens to instruction well, but does try testing the boundaries of what is allowed. \n\nSheya should be fed separately from other dogs as she has previously exhibited food aggression around other dogs. She has no issues with humans picking up or taking away food, treats or toys though. Treats and toys in shared/communal spaces are generally limited as a rule of the foster. Through a lot of hard work with her foster, Sheya has been able to relax and accept treats nearby her siblings.\n\nSheya's ideal home would be with a shepherd/working breed experienced owner - someone willing to put in the work to earn her trust and assert structure and obedience. She has so many of the wonderful shepherd qualities that endear the breed to their people but is plagued by the anxiety and high-strung personality that makes their ownership a (rewarding) challenge. She has demonstrated a lot of growth in the time she's been in foster but will require patience and diligent attention to training. \n\nIf you thought you always wanted a shepherd because you love everything about them then she may be perfect for you!\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nMeet the \"G\" litter. This litter of puppies was born at the county shelter to mom Greenley. A wonderful family saved them from being euthanized (yes, they are euthanizing moms & puppies for space at many shelters in Texas). \n\nGil (Gilbert), 10 months (estimated DOB 3/21/23), male, Pitbull mix, estimated medium size dog when full grown. He weighs about 50 pounds currently. He is in a foster home physically located in Houston, Texas and is able to transport from Texas to an approved adopter. He is the last of his litter to be adopted, so we are hoping his family is looking for him! \n\nGil is the most playful of the group. He shares a home with his mom and other dogs. His foster mom works at a doggy daycare and he's been able to go a few days a week. He LOVES playing with all the other dogs. He has really great manners. We would love to see him in a home with another dog to continue his positive socialization. If no other dog, please indicate how he will socialize with other dogs. \n\nHe is potty trained and does well when crated. He is still working on his leash skills. He is curious and loves adventures. He rides well in the car and enjoys pup cups. He likes to play in water, with toys and chasing balls. He is energetic, but after some play crashes out for awhile. He is friendly and always ready for whatever you adventure you have in mind. \n\nWe have no history with cats or kids and recommend a home with kids who respect and understand animal boundaries. \n\n\nFor puppies this age, someone needs to be home more than they are away as crating them for long periods of time is not conducive for their developmental needs. If you work outside of the home for 6 hours or more, please specify on the application who will be with the puppy during the time you are away. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

She is in a foster home in San Antonio, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved! \n\nIf you have checked out any of our other dogs profiles, you have probably seem so many of them are saved from euthanasia at county shelters in Texas. Essie's story begins the same way. We happened to be scrolling on Facebook, when we saw a volunteer post about her friend \"Comet.\" We reached out to the shelter not knowing he also was kenneled with Essie. The shelter gave us 10 minutes to decide if we could help both of them, as they were already in the pre-euthanasia room. We are really so grateful we found foster homes to save their lives. \n\n She has met other dog and had another foster temporarily stay with her. She is very friendly and polite with other dogs. If another dog engages her, she will play and is gentle in her style. She tends to read the energy of the other dog very well. When passing other dogs on leash, she is friendly. We think she would do great with another dog or would be okay as the only pet. \n\nShe is currently being fostered in an apartment setting. She does have zoomies occasionally and it appears when walking on leash she would like to move more. We think she would really enjoy a yard of her own. This is not required as she seems to do fine in her current setting. If no yard, she will need daily physical outlets. \n\nWe have no history with cats or kids. We recommend a home with kids 8 years and older who understand and respect animal boundaries. \n\nEssie does pretty well on the leash. She can be a little all over the place and can be a little jumpy at loud noises. She is fully housebroken and does very well in the crate. She loves food and her chew toys. She is crated when unsupervised as her foster mom has caught her chewing on a few household items. \n\nShe can be nervous when meeting new people. She is looking for a family who will be patient with her as she acclimates to a new environment. Although a dog is not required in the home, we do think a four legged friend helps her feel comfortable quicker. There are no current pets in her foster home, so we do know she is okay as the only pet. \n\nAs she opens up, she really loves pets and to be close to you. She is really a very sweet girl. We hope that in time, loud noises won't make her so nervous. She deserves a loving and patient home. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

If someone other than yourself is part of the decision making process, please make sure you have spoken with them and they are on board. We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nJunie B. Jones, 7 years old, spayed female, pitbull/retriever mix, 56 pounds. Junie is located in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of State once an adopter is approved.\n\nJunie B. was saved from a sure euthanasia fate at the local municipal shelter in Houston. We know little about her history prior to arriving at the shelter but it appeared she had been the victim of dog fights/attacks, as she was covered in wounds and scabs.\n\nSince being saved, Junie B. has put in lots of work with our trusted trainer and behaviorist and has done really well with the other dogs at his home. One of his males is her best friend, her \"Handsome Warren,\" if you will. Given her likely history prior to coming into rescue, we would advise Junie have *slow introductions* and time to acclimate to other dogs in the house but she has not been reactive nor does she respond when walking by dogs on a leash. \n\nSlow introductions typically look like a week spent away from other dogs in a space of their own, followed by \"crate and rotate\" - passing by the other animals in their crates and being allowed to sniff one another through the barriers. Once successful with passing by crates, introductions progress to being loose on opposite sides of a baby gate; pack walks with limited face-to-face interaction; supervised but still limited face-to-face interaction while all animals on a leash; and finally, loose but monitored interaction off lead.\n\nJunie has been clear: she may be an older gal but she is still a Party Animal - she loves to run and rollerblade, and does extremely well with her handler in these activities. On a typical day, Junie goes on one mile runs with her trainer. She is adamant that your New Year's Resolutions will not falter if she is by your side...call her The Boss of Lunch if you must, but you will get that exercise in no matter what!\n\nJunie has impeccable house manners: she has no issues in a crate and is potty trained, although regression is possible and adopters should be patient with any potential accidents due to disruption in her normal routine & schedule. She walks - and runs, clearly! - well on a leash and rides nicely in a car. She is very friendly to humans and is an overall loving dog, who takes simply stunning photos...so she is sure to quickly become your camera's favorite subject. She is quiet in the house and would love to wiggle into your lap and offer sweet kisses like a Mushy, Gushy Valentine.\n\nWe have no history with cats or children, and typically suggest homes with kids over the age of 10yrs, or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. Given Junie is now approaching her golden years, we expect she can safely be around younger children with proper introduction and supervision to ensure any unwanted behaviors are addressed ahead of time.\n\nWhile all of our dogs are special, we believe that Junie B. is the most deserving of a home of Her Own. She would love to be the only dog in your life and has been waiting patiently for her Furever Ever After - will you be the one to show her true love?\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nInterested in applying to adopt her?

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nMonty, 3.5 year old, neutered male, pit bull/American bully mix, 59 pounds. Monty is in TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nHe was saved from a shelter in San Antonio and has been through so much during his short life - he was found on running the streets underweight, with patchy hair and unsocialized around other dogs. Thanks to his foster instilling lots of foundational work, Monty has proven the resilience of a dog. \n\nMonty is your standard bully breed - lots of energy and a high play drive. He is neutral to other dogs when first introduced but warms up and really enjoys rough housing and wrestling. He would do best with a submissive pup as he can be rather bossy when it comes to play, but he is confident enough in himself to not require a canine sibling. He's been around male and female dogs and never shown any signs of aggression. \n\nMonty will require an active home where he will get physical exercise - not just walks but *play* time and mental stimulation - whether that be through training or \"brain\" games. He really values food and tug, and these have made training more rewarding for him & his foster. He knows sit, touch, place and off, as well as what a 'time out' means (calming down so play can resume). While not a formal heel, Monty knows how to loose leash walk next to you, pulling minimally. Monty responds very well to mild correction and positive reinforcement, so we don't think \"formal\" training is required to achieve positive behaviors. \n\nMonty has been around the foster's neighbors' kids (ages 3 and 5yrs) and did well. While they were jumping on the trampoline and having fun, Monty looked to his foster for guidance on how to proceed. We typically recommend home with kids over the age of 10yrs, or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. With proper supervision to ensure he doesn't get too animated, we believe Monty can safely be around small children. We have no history with cats.\n\nMonty is fully house trained and has not had any accidents in the home. He is crated when unable to be supervised and now enjoys his kennel, thanks in large part to his foster creating positive associations with the space. Monty should be fed away from other animals as he does tend to resource guard food. He allows his person to handle or remove food but he does not like to share. As a rule of his foster, toys are not left loose in communal spaces. Monty does need a good fence, he can jump anything under 5' and will push under a fence if not secured. \n\nLike most bully breeds, Monty is very people-oriented and loves human interaction. Overall he is pretty chill but would thrive with a breed experienced adopter willing to put in the time to provide structure and routine, enforce boundaries and additional training. He is very eager to please and catches on quickly.\n\nAnyone should be ecstatic to add this guy to their home and the sky is the limit with him! He has the sweetest demeanor and clearly the most perfect set of ears  either side of the Mississippi. \n \n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Lunesta is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nLulu is a sweet, medium energy kind of gal who loves to play. She is in a foster home with a resident pit bull and a shih tzu, and tries engaging them in play. She would love to have a home with a canine companion to play with her. The resident shih tzu will get barky and nippy at Lulu, and she walks away, ignoring him entirely. \n\nLulu doesn't have much body awareness and will body check the other dogs when playing or when treats come out. She pushes and shoves to the front of the line for a treat, to get the toy or to be the first one out the door. She can also be quite clumsy, sometimes running into the doors or walls because she is so focused on looking back at you.\n\nLulu loves to play but also loves to snuggle up and rest with you, or on her own in the crate or on the couch. She is a sweet cuddle bear and enjoys following you around the house ensuring you are never alone nor under attack from an unseen foe. Going to the kitchen? Lulu's coming too. Need to use the restroom? Good idea, she should join you. Headed outside for some vitamin D? Perfect, that is just what she wanted to do also! Not even joking, Lulu really does love the sun and baking as long as you will let her.\n\nLulu is a toy hoarder. She will sneak and steal the toys from her siblings but is not aggressive of them. As a general rule of the foster, all dogs are fed separately to ensure they eat their own meals but not because anyone resource guards their food.\n\nWe have no history with cats but when walking her and she sees one, she wants to charge at it. She has been around children ages 10 and up without issue, and we have no reason to think she couldn't be around very young kids as she's not super jumpy or energetic. Typically recommend a home with kids over the age of 10 years, or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues.\n\nLulu does need to work on her leash manners as she is all over the place and pulls with the typical pittie energy. A harness or Gentle Leader head collar may yield the best results but Lulu's foster has been working patiently with her on this training. Lulu is nearly fully housetrained but will \"go\" if it has been too long between her potty breaks. She does not have any accidents overnight in her kennel. Lunesta is crate trained and does very well, sleeping and taking her meals in the kennel, as well as being put up when unable to be supervised. \n\nShe would do best in a home willing to help her reinforce the basic manners she already has, ensuring a good solid connection through training and structure. She would enjoy a moderately active house with some walks and fetch opportunities, lots of snuggles and cuddles, and possibly another doggy sibling or two. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\nBugs, 8 month old, spayed female, pitbull mix, 20lbs. Bugs is in a foster home in San Antonio, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nBugs was in the city shelter with her sister, Bunny, huddled together in the pre-euth area. We tagged both girls but her sister was adopted before we were able to pick them up, so Bugs has been safe in our care since.\n\nHer nickname is Bugs McCuddles because she doesn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to cuddle or be petted, especially if you are sitting down. She is super sweet and loving toward her humans. Timid with strangers but warms up quickly.  When Bugs gets excited from playing, she sometimes gets \u201cmouthy\u2019 with her foster and tries to nibble her hands or legs. Her foster is working with her with redirection.\n\nBugs, while initially timid and unsure meeting dogs, lives in a foster home with several resident dogs and plays with all sizes- large, medium, and small (80 lb. Staffordshire Terrier, 45lb Black mouth Cur, 30 lb. Shepherd mix to a 12 lb. Chiweenie). Bugs would do best in a home with another dog of similar age and energy level to continue building her confidence and socialization. \n\nBugs plays hard: she enjoys playing chase & tackle, tug of war and with a tethered bungie/rope toy with her foster siblings.  She especially likes to play with stuffed toys that have squeakers, chew her antlers & cow hoofs. She enjoys playing when she wakes up early in the morning and throughout the day but she also really enjoys her naps at all hours of the day. Bugs\u2019 energy when playing is middle of the road/moderate - she is quite chill for being so young.\n\nBugs is working on her leash walking right now, so she has not had a great deal of exposure to other dogs who are on a leash. Presently, Bugs freezes when we leash her. Super scared, Bugs came to her foster very frightened of everything including people, so even stepping outside took a couple of days. \n\nBugs is 50% house broken and is transitioning from pee-pads to going outdoors and communicating her need to go by using bells on the door. Bugs is crated when her foster leaves and for sleeping at night, doing fine. Since she is still young and not yet house trained, Bugs is not left loose in the house while unattended.\n\nBugs has been around older kids - 12-16 years old - with no issues at all. We believe she would be okay with small children based on her energy level, which is moderate. We have no history of cats.\n \nBugs' ideal home would be a moderately active one with a yard and another dog to play with of similar age and energy level. She will thrive in a home with forever parents who are patient and willing to work through Bug\u2019s fears with her. Forever parents who are experienced dog owners, with a familiarity of rescue pup decompression stages. Bugs wants to be around her humans and cuddle, and she is eager to please.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Dianna is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nDianna lives only with her foster mom, so she's not had much socialization around dogs once she was saved from the shelter. Her foster mom has been working to introduce Dianna to other dogs - Dianna has done best outside the house but did get a bit barky and on guard of her home environment when the dog was brought into the house. With time and more experience, we are confident Dianna will be comfortable sharing her home with a doggy sibling. \n\nDianna is prototypical pittie - athletic, high energy, fun-loving with lots of playful antics. She loves to romp and roam, jump and play, especially with chew toys. She is very high energy and does best in a harness because she loooooves being outdoors so she tends to pull. Dianna is quite strong, so her foster mom is working hard with Dianna to improve her manners on the leash. \n\nWe have no history with cats. Dianna has been around older kids - ages 10 and 13 years - and done well. We recommend a home with kids 10 years or older, or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. Because of Dianna's energy and excitability, she may inadvertently knock over a small child.\n\nDianna is fully house trained and has only had an accident indoors when  someone isn't paying attention to her signals of needing to go outside. She does really well in the kennel and is fully trained in that regard. Her foster mom crates Dianna when unable to supervise her because Dianna does like chewing on things, including every toy she comes across.\n \nDianna has not shown any issues with toys or treats, but does love to beg for food. She has never met a stranger and loves all people, cuddling when calm and rubbing herself against your legs like a cat. She \"corn cobs\" when excited, giving little nibble kisses. She is a jumper but Dianna's foster has been working with her on this, too.\n\nDianna's ideal home would be someone who is breed experienced and is willing to provide structure and routine, putting in time training her. She would do well with a young active couple, who would take her for walks or adventures. She is very loving and wants to please.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Buttercup resides in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nButtercup was saved from the county shelter and was housed with another dog, and went into a foster home with other pups. She was able to do integrate well but, because of her hearing impairment, she gets startled easily and becomes very defensive when surprised. It is not that she cannot be around other dogs but she needs time to feel comfortable and secure before letting her guard down. To alleviate this, we have found putting up a fence/x-pen and allowing her to see/\"meet\" the dogs before being let loose with them works best for Buttercup. \n\nButtercup has learned some basic obedience using hand signals and tactile marks, and has learned to connect seeing other dogs with a long tap on her right shoulder. Her ideal home would be one who sees her hearing challenges as an opportunity to connect on a deeper level with her and will take the time to train Buttercup, whether on their own or through professional courses.\n\nButtercup is very human friendly and affectionate. She's a gentle lovebug working to navigate her way through this world with the guidance of her human. She would do best with kids 10 years or older due to her size and hearing issues, which may result in her being startled by young kids. \n\nButtercup is a solid 4/10 level dog - she can be playful and excited but her default is to sit back and watch, assess. She is well mannered and doesn't beg, and is overall easy to handle on the leash, with minimal reactivity on walks. She is fully house and crate trained, and enjoys snoozing in bed or riding in a car for adventures.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Kenzy is in a foster home in Houston, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nKenzy and her two siblings were housed at the county shelter when we were notified of the family; while we were working to get plans in place for the whole family, Kenzy's siblings were euthanized. We've since learned that without the comfort and security of another dog, poor Kenzy is unsure how to navigate being in a home environment.\n\nThankfully, Kenzy is very dog friendly - she loves running around and playing, falling into line with the group with ease - and her ideal home will have a resident dog or established pack. She is still shy and quiet, and needs the assurance from another dog on how to \"dog\" in this world. \n\nKenzy has been in a foster home with many dogs - large and small - and she plays with them all. She is a medium energy girl, she plays until she's done and then goes off to find a quiet place to rest - like under a table. :) While her foster mom works, Kenzy is often found curled up with the other dogs chilling or napping.\n\nKenzy has exhibited no issues with meeting dogs on/off a leash and walks calmly next to you with only the standard \"I'm excited to go out for a walk\" pulling. After being in the home for months now, the foster trusts Kenzy to be off leash. She doesn't play much with toys so there have been no issues there, and she has additionally displayed no negative behaviors around food or treats. \n\nWe have no history with cats or kids but given her calm demeanor, we do not anticipate any issues with children. We typically recommend a home with kids aged 10 years or older, or those who can understand and will respect animal behavior cues. Although she does warm up, Kenzy is shy and still uncomfortable with \"in your face\" affection, so very young children should be supervised around her to ensure she's given time and space. \n\nKenzy is crated at night and when unable to be supervised. She feels safe and sometimes prefers going to her kennel for respite, and has shown no separation anxieties or destructive behavior. Kenzy is house and doggy door trained but until she learns the ropes of the house, she may have an accident or two. \n \nKenzy's ideal home doesn't need to be overly active or work from home but should have a dog or two in the house. She will need someone willing to be patient and allow her to set the pace but giving her the confidence to tackle new things. She is a beautiful sweet girl with a gentle spirit - she just needs time to get used to you.

Comet is in a foster home in San Antonio, TEXAS and can transport out of state once an approved adopter is lined up!\n\nComet AKA Buddy was saved from the county shelter in San Antonio, having been rescued from the streets with a friend, Essie. Both dogs were saved without plans and have since landed in foster homes! \n\nBuddy lives in a foster home with another (female) dog. He was initially wary when being introduced but now is very friendly and playful. He has a fairly high but not obnoxious energy level and loves to run the zoomies.  Buddy would love having a canine sibling for companionship. He has a good playstyle and has show no food/resource aggression around the resident dogs.\n\nWe have no history with cats or kids, but he will be tested with kids soon. Based upon his behavior to date, the foster has no concerns about his ability to get along well with young children. We typically recommend a home with kids aged 10 years or older, or those who can understand and respect animal behavior cues.\n\nBuddy is fully house, crate and leash trained. He sleeps in his kennel at night and does not whine or cry, and he does not pull on the leash. Since going into foster, he has not had any accidents in the house and will alert you when he needs to go potty. Buddy doesn't appear to have any issues with separation anxiety but is crated when he isn't able to be supervised because his one vice is loving to chew - he's chewed two dog beds so far!\n\nWhile he has made strong strides in the short time he's been in a foster home, Buddy is still a bit wary of new people but does go to greet them. Having likely been rebuffed while running wild, as soon as Buddy knows he\u2019s not going to be hit/kicked, he opens up.\n\nBuddy's favorite thing is to please, so he has been easy to train and does not require hard corrections. He is very sweet, affectionate and seeks out cuddles, happy to be anywhere with you. He is a resilient and adaptable dog who is looking for his forever buddy!\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

We really do not want to waste anyone's time if you are not serious about adopting this dog.\n\n\n\nLuigi, 7 months (approximate DOB March 2023), neutered male, Hound/Retriever mix (taking our best guess), currently 42 pounds but not full grown. He is located in a foster home in Houston, Texas and can transport out of State to an approved adopter. \n\nSo many of our dogs have \"stories\" before they come into rescue. Luigi and his two siblings were thrown out of a moving car. Another one of our foster homes witnessed it happen and immediately took them in. She was not able to keep them, so we moved them to their current home. We never understand why people do some of the things they do. Thankfully, none of the puppies were harmed and are currently happy and healthy. \n\nLuigi is a typical puppy who has spurts of energy and then naps or chills out for awhile. He is not fully housebroken and has a few accidents from time to time. He does okay when crated. His foster mom uses one of those pens so he has more space to move around. \n\nHe is very friendly with other dogs and we think would really benefit from another dog in the home. This will help him continue his positive social skills and another dog will help teach him the ropes. \n\nWe have no history with cats. He has been around kids and is very sweet. He will jump up. We always recommend homes with kids who understand and are respectful of animal boundaries. \n\nHe is incredibly sweet and cuddly. He is always carrying something in his mouth. He has a soft happy whine he makes. He really really loves soft toys to carry around. \n\nLuigi will need continued work walking on leash. He is looking for a home who is excited for the joys and challenges a puppy brings. A home who is committed to providing structure and basic obedience. \n\n\nFor puppies this age, someone needs to be home more than they are away as crating them for long periods of time is not conducive for their developmental needs. This means if you work outside of the house more than 4 hours a day, you need to indicate on the application who will be home to let him out to potty. \n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

He is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport out of State to an approved adopter. We are partnering with his rescue, Blue River Animal Rescue. \n\nRex was adopted as a young dog and then returned to the city shelter in Houston two years later. He had been chained outside in the adopter's yard. Unfortunately he was under socialized with other animals. \n\nRex is a true GEM. He has so so much love to give and loves people so much. He also gives unending and unstoppable kisses. He is very people friendly. He would need to be your only pet, but don\u2019t let that stop you from reading further. ?\n\nDespite Rex's past, he has shown a dog's resiliency, forgiveness and unconditional love. He was saved from the shelter\u2019s euthanasia list, stayed in boarding for 7 months, and finally came to us in Feb 2023. In his time with us, he has met several friends of ours and stolen everyone\u2019s heart!?\n\nRex knows sit and down, is doing great with \u201cPlace\u201d. He is crate and potty trained, is very food motivated and learns quickly. He is a very happy, low-maintenance boy who enjoys some activity, as well as snoozing while we work during the day. He is fairly quiet with not a lot of barking. \n\nHe recently completed a 3 week training stay with one of our trainers and did really well. We would be happy to chat more about this and include his trainer in any conversation. \n\nRex is incredibly deserving of a home of his own. He is great with big and little people. He wants to shower you with love.  Are you ready to give Rex a home?\n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

Transports run every few weeks and we will have the dog on the next available transport once approved. If you are not able to accept a dog until a specific time period, please apply at that time************\n\n\nGreenley, 4 years old, spayed female, Pitbull Terrier mix, 44 pounds. She is in a foster home in HOUSTON, TEXAS and can transport to another state once an adopter is approved. \n\nGreenley and her puppies were rescued from euthanasia after being at the county shelter in Houston. Yes, the whole family was at risk of being put down! A wonderful family took them all in. Two of her puppies are still looking for homes and the other four have been adopted. She's been a really great mom to her pups and has always been super affectionate to humans around her pups. \n\nShe also shares a home with two adult dogs. She is energetic and wants to play with them. She does a lot of play bowing and wrestling. If there is another dog in the home, she needs one who enjoys and will engage in play. \n\nThere is a cat, rabbit and parrot in the house. She is kept separated from these pets with no issue, but we do not trust her to be unsupervised with them. \n\nShe has been around teenagers and has done well. She really loves to cuddle. She will jump up when excited (not onto you, but straight up into the air). We recommend a home with kids 10 years and older. \n\nGreenley generally walks calmly on leash. She will get distracted, but you can easily draw her attention with a treat. She is crate trained and housebroken. \n\nShe is looking for a moderately active home. She would love to go on walks, trails, hikes etc. She has some bursts of energy and then chills out for awhile. She absolutely LOVES water! She is fairly calm when in the house and shows more energy when out in the yard. She is very food motivated and eager to please. \n\nHer favorite toys are ones with squeakers. She is very affectionate and loving with her humans. She is happy to meet new people and greets them with tail wags. She is a little nervous when first riding in the car, but quickly settles in. \n\nShe would do great with another playful dog or would do great as the only pet. She is really looking for people who are affectionate and cuddly with her. She would also love a house with a hose to play in/with! She gets super excited and dances when you come into the room even if it\u2019s only been a minute. She will talk to you if she feels she needs more attention.\n\n\n\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess & recommendations from our veterinarian on age, breed and size when fully grown.

        "description": "Hutch it seems had been out on his own for quite a while before being taken into foster. He is a very calm and well mannered guy who wants to just be near his humans. Hutch is a little shy when first meeting new adults, but quickly warms up and likes to stay close. He has also been very respectful around a 5 year boy who came over to play. Hutch is not much interested in playing with other dogs, but he does get along well with them. He would probably be just as happy being the only dog. Hutch walks well on a leash, knows how to use a doggie door and is house trained. Hutch will make a very loyal family member.Please submit an application at http://helpinghoundsdogrescue.org A processed application is required to visit the rescue.",

Belle is great with the other dogs in her foster home, but cats...not so much. She has great leash manners and would be a perfect walking, running, or hiking partner. She loves the water whether it's the people pool, the puppy pool, or just the water hose. She is so smart - of course she is, she is part Shepherd. She has already learned to sit on command and shake hands. She is the life of the party, and everyone who meets her loves her! Belle is still all puppy, so she will need plenty of durable chew toys.

        "description": "Emmons (friends and family call her Emmy) is a 5 year old, 45 lb Red Heeler mix. She has the most beautiful markings and the cutest wagging, nubby tail! Super sweet and calm, very attentive, wants to be close to her human. Emmons is a bit bashful and cautious of her new environment, but she is showing a little more confidence and playfulness every day. Her face is very expressive and she's easy to read! She does her bashful look, happy look, big eyed surprised look, side-eye check-in look, and more. She is not interested in toys or chew bones yet, but she appreciates chicken feet, and is very interested in the snuffle mat. Emmons is a smart girl and listens and responds very well. She is house-broken and can be trusted with run of the house. She walks well on a leash and likes to sniff the neighborhood along the way. She also has great manners on car rides. She doesn't live with other dogs in her foster home, but we think she would be fine with another laid-back dog. Emmons is a cattle dog and may have tendencies to herd her people, so we are recommending no kids under the age of 6. Bottom line: Emmons is a wonderful girl that just wants someone to love and be loved back. Easy peasy little mama bear.Please submit an application at http://helpinghoundsdogrescue.org A processed application is required to visit the rescue.",

She gets along with most dogs, but because she is such a people dog Loretta would probably make a wonderful only dog in the family. IT IS A NO TO CATS! Loretta has not interacted with any children and would probably do best with older, calm, respectful kids. Loretta is crate and house trained.

She is better with confident dogs, as a nervous girl herself, it's best to have another dog around who isn't so shy. She was curious about her most recent fosters cats. Playful enough that she would most likely do fine in a home with cats in the future. Ophelia would also most likely do best with respectful toddlers if not just kids 5 and up. She is working very hard on her house and leash training. She does well in her crate, especially after a good romp around to get some energy out. Foster said she slept through the night when crated with no accidents. All in all, Ophelia is a great pup and will make a terrific companion.Please submit an application at http://helpinghoundsdogrescue.org A processed application is required to visit the rescue.",

        "description": "Are you looking for a furry companion who is full of joy and love? Look no further than Zero, the adorable 15-pound dog who is sure to steal your heart with his playful antics and sweet nature.\n\nZero is the epitome of happiness in a small package. Despite his petite size, he has a big personality that shines through in everything he does. His playful demeanor will bring a smile to your face and warmth to your heart. Whether he's chasing his tail in the yard or cuddling up on the couch, Zero is always ready for fun and affection.\n\nIf you have other small pets at home, Zero is the perfect companion for them. He gets along great with small dogs and cats, making him a wonderful addition to a multi-pet household. While Zero is a social butterfly with small dogs and cats, he can be a bit intimidated by bigger dogs. We do not recommend him living with large dogs.\n\nOne of the best things about Zero is that he is already leash trained and housetrained. This means you can enjoy long walks in the park with him without any hassle, and you won't have to worry about accidents in the house. Zero is a well-behaved pup who is ready to fit right into your daily routine.\n\nFor Pet's Sake Rescue is a Mississippi\u00a0based rescue. All animals are currently in MS.

Zi is a special dog with a lot of love to give, but she comes with some unique needs that make finding the right match crucial.\n\nZi is a loving and affectionate dog who adores humans. She thrives on attention and companionship, and is always eager to shower her human friends with her playful demeanor. Despite her friendly nature, Zi struggles to get along with other dogs and cats. This makes it challenging for her to find a home where she can be the center of attention.\n\nZi's journey has not been an easy one. She ended up in the boarding kennel.

Zi longs for a home where she can feel safe, secure, and loved unconditionally.\n\nZi may have some challenges when it comes to interacting with other animals, but her love for humans knows no bounds. She is loyal, affectionate, and eager to please. With the right training and guidance, Zi has the potential to flourish in a loving home environment.\n\nIf you are considering adding a furry friend to your family and are willing to provide Zi with the love and attention she deserves, please consider adopting her. While Zi may not be the perfect fit for every household, she is a special dog who deserves a chance at a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nZi is currently in Mississippi.

But she can be an only dog as she really is more about humans than her furry companion. Her foster parents love her and think she will make an amazing addition. \n\nGreta rode out Hurricane Beryl like a champ, with no anxiety.  \n\nShe loves bellyrubs, and cuddles. She has zoomies every now and then, because she gets so happy when her foster parents come home from work. \n\nGerman shepherd experience is mandatory to adopt our GSDs. \n\nGreta is 2 yo, currently weighs 72 lbs, fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped. and heartworm negative. She is kept on heartworm and flea preventative. \n\nShe is being fostered in Texas, but can travel to many states and even Canada. \n\nTo meet this adorable pup, please send a completed application via www.savesomesouls.com \n\nYards must be fully and adequately fenced, to be considered for our pups.

        "description": "Salt is an affectionate, silly, loveable 1.5 year old Pointer/Labrador Retriever mix who is the definition of a velcro dog. This 55lb medium sized boy just wants to be by your side getting loved on all day every day! One of his favorite things to do is go outside and roll around on the mesh dog cots we have here. It must feel pretty good, because he always makes a series of hilarious grunts and groans when he does it! He thinks it's the ultimate back massage!\n\nSalt came to us off the streets of Houston with his brother, Pepper, who has already been adopted. Salt has always been the shy one towards people but when he and his brother were still puppies, he acted like his brother's protector! He likes to act all macho at first, but he's really just a big ole mush who wants your love. \n\nSalt is a dog who thrives on routine and he'll often have a brief panic if something changes- such as moving his crate slightly. We like to say that he's on the spectrum because he's so peculiar about the way he wants things! True to his nature, Salt is reserved with new people at first. Once he gets a feel for your lifestyle and the way you do things, he quickly runs in stride with it and attaches to your hip! \n\nSalt isn't much of an active dog, but he does occasionally get the zoomies when he's feeling a little bit crazy! He thoroughly enjoys being around other dogs, especially if they practically worship him like his adoptable friend, Roscoe, does! Salt would be happiest in a quiet home with at least one other dog to accompany him. While he would prefer to have a canine sibling in the home, he would also be content with just a human who is home most of the day and can give him all the attention he wants.

        "description": "Codi is a senior Labrador Retriever/Hound mix who is estimated to be around 10 years old. In late April, Codi was dumped on the side of a busy highway in Cleveland TX with another dog. His friend unfortunately got hit by a car and died before anyone could render aid to either of them. Ever-loyal Codi stayed by his deceased friend's side for days refusing to eat or drink, until he was finally able to be caught by his rescuer.\n\nCodi was extremely shut down after he was rescued. This poor boy was skin and bones, had scars and open wounds all over his body, was riddled with fleas, ticks, and all sorts of other parasites, and was missing most of his teeth. He was so terrified of people that nobody could even look at him without him cowering.\nOnce in foster care, Codi quickly attached to resident dog, Bernie, and used him as a guide to help him navigate his new environment. Learning from Bernie's example, Codi started to warm up to people and learned that not everyone is bad. Now, after a few months in a foster home, Codi loves to sleep on the bed with his foster mom and does full-body tail wag wiggles when he's happy. He is not shy about asking for attention and loves to be pet! Codi is still understandably wary of new people at first, but he warms up quickly once you gain his trust.\n\nCodi has come such a long way since being rescued those few months ago. For some time after he was rescued, Codi was too scared to even step foot outside in fear that he wouldn\u2019t get to come back in. It\u2019s been a process getting him to learn that he\u2019ll never have to be on his own again, and he shows his gratitude every day. He has gained so much confidence and has a great lust for life now. Codi is housetrained, goes outside and comes back in flawlessly, knows to go to the door when he needs to potty, and is much less fearful of new things. Codi is good with all other dogs of every size and age, and he loves cats! He's the whole package!\nCodi is unfortunately heartworm positive from his many years of living on the streets, but he will get treatment before adoption. He has become such a great dog and would really thrive in a calm, patient, multi-dog household. He definitely has many more years ahead of him, and we want to make them the best ones yet!\n\nCodi is located in Houston TX but can be transported to most US states for adoption.",

This petite girl started out as the most reserved out of her 2 other siblings (Addison and Ryder, who has already been adopted) but she quickly fell in stride with her more outgoing sister! Chai looks to her sister, Addison, to lead the way most of the time, but she definitely adds her fair share to the puppy mischief! You can often find these two troublemakers side by side in action. They're two spunky partners in crime!\n\nChai was found with her sister and older brother from a different litter, Ryder, on the streets of Houston. Their mother was nowhere to be found so she and her siblings had to fend for themselves until a kind lady came along and rescued them and they made their way to us! Since being here, Chai has gained lots of confidence and is right on track to grow into a well-rounded adult dog! \n\nChai is a smart little pup who likes to be next to her people most of the time. She never strays too far and is a good listener. She loves to be challenged and enjoys figuring out puzzles and working out how to do things on her own. She may get discouraged when she can't figure things out as quickly as she wants to, but she never gives up! \n\nChai is good with other dogs, cats, and people of all kinds. She would do well in most environments/households and is an easy-to-please pup! Chai would thrive best in a home with at least one other canine companion to romp around with, but this is not required for her to be happy. Chai is about 30lbs currently and is expected to get no bigger than 40lbs fully grown. \n\nChai is located in Houston TX but can be transported to most US states for adoption.\n",

Missy is a bit of a hefty girl weighing in at about 70lbs, but she acts like a lap dog! Her favorite thing, other than cuddling with her people, is playing with her toys and you'll often find her with one in her mouth. Bonus points if they squeak! Missy loves being outside and likes to plop down in the grass or sand and just sunbathe til her hearts content.\n\nMissy was found on the streets of Houston almost 2 years ago and has sadly had no adoption interest in that time. We don't know why- she's the perfect girl! Missy is extremely friendly and loves meeting new people. She's so gentle and asks for pets very kindly. She can be a bit stubborn at times if you ask her to do something, but she does it in the cutest way- by rolling over and asking for belly rubs! Her most happy place is laying in bed with you, snoring away! \n\nMissy is house trained, crate trained, knows a few commands, and does well on a leash. She would love to be a lounge dog, simply napping the day away and enjoying activities with her humans. She is such a sweet, people-loving, patient girl who really deserves the best home. Missy is good with other dogs but likes to be the leader, so a home with a less dominant dog would be best for her. She would also not mind being the center of attention as the only dog in the household!

This guy is a large breed mix weighing in at around 100lbs, and he may even get a little bigger! Despite his intimidating size, Bo is one of the sweetest dogs you'll ever meet. He thinks he's a lap dog and loves cuddles on the couch!\n\nBo came to us with his brother, Hooch, after his owner was evicted and had nowhere to take them. It's obvious that they were well raised and well loved as they're both perfect houseguests! Bo is a puppy so he still has some of that unfiltered puppy energy, but he tends to match the vibe of the people around him rather well. Bo loves to play with other dogs and is easy to get along with. He is very respectful of other dogs' personal space and reads their behaviors well. Since he was an owner surrender from a household with children, we know firsthand that Bo does great with kids! \n\nBo is house trained, kennel trained, knows some commands, and is very smart and attention motivated. There's nothing he can't learn with the right owner! This handsome boy is looking for a home with at least one other dog that he can be buddies with, and preferably someone with experience with large breed dogs and their needs. Bo is such a lover and would do well in just about any environment!\n\nBo is located in Houston TX but can be transported to most US states for adoption.",

        "description": "Hooch is a stunning, charming, quiet-natured 4 year old Dogue de Bordeaux aka French Mastiff mix. This big block-headed boy is quite the lover and likes to pretend that he's a lap dog, even though he weighs nearly 130lbs! With his big floppy ears and gorgeous rusty coat, he knows he's all that! \n\nHooch came to us with his brother, Bo, after their owner was evicted and had nowhere for them to go. It's obvious that they were well raised and well loved as they're perfect houseguests! Hooch has great manners in the house and mostly likes to sleep throughout the day. Being that handsome is hard work, you know! When he's not sleeping the day away, Hooch loves to cuddle up to his people and get as much attention as he can. He shows amazing body language when meeting other dogs for the first time and is very patient. He's a very loyal boy who likes to stick close to his people and make sure they're safe. \n\nOne unique thing about this boy is his oddly shaped tail. You might notice in his pictures that it appears to be bent in the middle- and that's exactly right! When Hooch was a little puppy before he was rescued by his previous owner, he was in a bad situation/location where dogs aren't  treated nicely at all. It appears that someone crushed his tail in a door which caused it to break and heal back improperly. Don't get him wrong though, he still knows how to wag that thing at high speeds! He does have some tenderness where his tail was broken and doesn't like to have it messed with a bunch, but otherwise it has given him no issues.\n\nHooch has been around kids his whole life and does remarkably well with them. He's a very gentle, watchful babysitter and takes his job very seriously. If he senses that something isn't right, he'll let you know right away! His bark, though seldom heard, can sound loud and scary but it's all for show. This guy is actually a big smooshy scaredy-cat! He can be a bit wary of strangers at first, but he warms up quickly.\n\nHooch is house trained, crate trained, knows a few commands, and does fairly well on a leash. He is good with other dogs but does not require a canine companion to live his happiest life. All he really wants is someone to love on and nap with him all day!\n\nHooch is located in Houston TX but can be transported to most US states for adoption.",

She will stop by to say hello to the dogs who were on walks, but was very hard to trap. \n\nWhen the heat in Texas reached 90, Luna started coming around to a home she chose and allowed being petted. The owner of the property was able to touch her and finally she started living inside with three kitties, and soon came to our foster home. \n\nOnce in foster home, Luna turned out to be a super sweet girl, who was quiet, and shy, and loves kids. \n\nLuna has no separation anxiety and quite independent.\n\nLuna  is extremely loyal, sensitive, calm and housebroken. \nShe loves to play fetch and will love a home with a fully fenced yard, where she gets playtime with her furever parents.   \n\nLuna needs a home with a fully and adequately fenced yard. \n\nShe is 65 lb, fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative and kept on heartgard and nexgard. \n \nShe is extremely beautiful, very calm, and adorable. Once she has gotten over her initial shyness, she becomes completely velcro, and loves to be petted.   \n\nLuna is currently in Houston, but can transport to other places.\n\nIf you are interested to adopt Luna, please send an application via savesomesouls.com\n\n**Yards must be fully fenced to adopt our pups.

        "description": "Suki is a 3 year old Rottie mix girl who is a dream. \n\nSuki was found as a stray, living in an apartment complex, and eating from a supermarket next door. Our team member saw her and had to trap her as she was too intelligent and would not come to humans on her own. She was so easy to trap, that it felt as if she wanted to be rescued.  \n\nSuki lives with her foster parents' Belgian malinois Emma (you can see the video of them at the beach) and loves to follow her around. They live very close to the beach and are there every morning. Her foster mom says she seems to be fascinated with birds - whether because she wants to eat them or just simply enjoys their song is yet to be determined\n\nSuki is extraordinarily smart and very affectionate and loving.  \n\nWhen her foster parents leave for work, she takes one of their shoes to where she is laying down - she doesn\u2019t chew it up, just puts it next to her and only one, not both. \n\nShe is not a fan of crate but will comply if needed. \n\nA home with a fully fenced yard would be mandatory for her, as well as a family who can dedicate time, patience and love. \n\nSuki is currently about 86 lb and fully vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. She is kept on heartworm and flea preventative. \n\nShe is great with dogs but has not lived with kids or cats in our care, so we do not know how she is going to be around children or cats.  \n\nSweet Suki is being fostered in Texas, but can travel to any state, and even Canada for the right home.  Rottweiler experience is mandatory to adopt our breed specific pups. \n\nTo meet this gorgeous pup via facetime or whatsapp or other video chat apps, please send a completed application via www.savesomesouls.com\n\nYards MUST BE adequately and fully fenced to adopt our pups.  We do not accept electric or underground fences.",

Even though I may be a bit shy at first, I am a very friendly dog and I am super curious about the world around me. I love to explore and I love to cuddle on the couch with my human friends.

I'm an all-around great dog and I'm excited to meet my new family! I may not know how I am with other dogs yet, but with my sweet and playful personality, I'm sure I'll make some four-legged friends in no time!

The story goes that some kind people found me after I was allegedly stomped on by some cruel human who had no disregard for my well-being. It left me with a severely damaged back left leg. Thankfully those kind people sought help and Project Freedom Ride answered. They immediately took me to the emergency vet and after meeting the amazing Dr. Kunkle at Blue Pearl it was determined I was a great candidate for an amputation. It would allow me the quickest and easiest recovery and at just a couple months old that was exactly what I needed. On May 21st that damaged leg was removed, and I have never looked back. Nothing can slow me down now!! \n\nMore about me \u2026 \n\n* Yep! I\u2019m a tripod\n* Age \u2013 estimated birthday is March 25th, 2024\n* Weight \u2013 estimated at 20-25lb as of July 22nd, 2024\n* Social butterfly\n* Super outgoing and playful\n* Dog Friendly. Fostered with other dogs\n* Cats are unknown and per our adoption policy if not fostered with cats will not adopt to a home with cats for everyone\u2019s safety\n* Learning commands like sit & wait and am doing rather well for my age\n* Love squeaky toys & nylabones\n* Will cuddle some but not long periods of time .. I love to play\n* Still working on fetch, it\u2019s a weird concept\n* Still working on crate training overnight and some days while my foster mom is at work (6-8 hrs) \u2013 only #1 accidents \u2013 never #2\n* Very treat motivated\n* Although new places can be a little bit of an adjustment for me, with the noises and all, I would love to find paw-rents who are social like me. Let\u2019s get out and see the world together. Got another dog \u2013 even better. I would LOVE a buddy! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Poppy please fill out the inquiry form here (copy paste link into browser): https://form.jotform.com/211295763938164\n\nPoppy is currently fostered in GA but is available for adoption throughout the country thanks to our transport program \n\nPoppy\u2019s adoption fee is $500 which includes her spay, current vaccinations (rabies, 4 parvo/distemper boosters, and Bordetella), negative heartworm test (if 6+ mths old at transport), negative fecal within 14 days of transport, health certificate within 10-days of transport, registered microchip, and transport costs. \n\nAs a Project Freedom Ride direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet would take place on a video call (FB Messenger Call, Facetime, Zoom, Etc).

        "description": "Meet BEAN !\n\nBEAN is a 2 to 3 year old Bully mix that came into a Texas kill shelter after neither his owner or any of his family was able to care for him. He had been injured pretty badly by roaming dogs prior to coming into the animal shelter. Our group got him to the veterinarian clinic and his injuries were repaired. Bean then went to a medical foster to heal after losing weight and not doing well in the shelter environment. He is now fully healed and healthy. He walks well on leash, although he will pull a little unless he has a halter on while walking. He is doing better with his walks as we have been doing some training with him. He does well with other dogs as long as they are introduced slowly. He is not good with cats as he likes to chase them a little too much. He likes all people that he has met and is a happy guy with a fun personality ! He has not been around young children in the foster\u2019s home and due to his size, he would tend to unintentionally bump into them. He would be better with children over 8 years old. Bean is a sweet dog that would make a great walking buddy, but would also love to curl up and watch sports or movies with his family. \n\n*Bean is around 2-3 years old and weighs about 50 pounds. \n\n*He is doing pretty well on a leash and loves to go on walks. \n\n*He is good with other dogs when introduced slowly and is around other dogs in his foster home. \n\n*He loves all people !\n\n*He has a great smile !\n\nHere\u2019s some more videos of BEAN:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/bEdbFHJJWLg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/1x-M_3huGuo\n\n\nBean's adoption fee is $500 which includes his neuter, current vaccinations (rabies, 2 parvo/distemper boosters, and bordatella), negative heartworm test, negative fecal, health certificate, registered microchip, and transport costs.\n\nBean\u2019s local adoption fee is $200 (travel costs are not needed).\n\nHe is available through Levelland Animal Friends, a partner rescue of Project Freedom Ride. We are located in the Texas Panhandle. He is located with our rescue here in Texas. He would be transported on one of the PFR transports to either Meridian ID, SLC, UT, Seattle, WA, Mt Vernon, WA, Kennewick, WA, Portland, OR, Buffalo/Syracuse/Newburgh/Castleton on Hudson, NY, Philadelphia, PA, Pittsburgh, PA, Cleveland, OH, Columbus, OH, Springfield, IL, Chicago, IL, Des Moines, IA, Indianapolis, IN, Baltimore, MD, Lansing, MI, Grand Rapids, MI, Kansas City, MO, Minneapolis, MN, Stevens Point, WI, Madison, WI, Springfield/Richmond, VA, or Bedminster, NJ. For more information on how a Direct Adoption with Project Freedom Ride works or to meet this boy via video call, email laf79336@gmail.com.\n\nAs a Project Freedom Ride direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet would take place on video call (Facetime, FB Messenger Call, WhatsApp, or Google Duo). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.\n\nAdoption application can be accessed at the link below.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/241436494645160\n\nCheck out Project Freedom Ride and see what this amazing group is all about!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ProjectFreedomRide/\n\nhttp://projectfreedomride.org/\n",

        "description": "Meet LUCKY!\n\nMeet our 80 lb. foster Lucky! He is a handsome Anatolian Shepherd mix male. He and his female friend had a great life until their owner died about 6 months ago. The owner\u2019s out of state family was having someone go by to feed him and his friend, but eventually, they got out of the yard where they were living and animal control picked them up. They were put up for adoption at the local shelter. The female friend ended up being euthanized and Lucky got lucky and didn\u2019t suffer the same fate because someone was supposed to be coming for him. Unfortunately, the potential adopters were a no show, so a great foster stepped in to take Lucky home with her to save him. He is updated on vaccinations, heartworm negative and has been started on flea/tick/heartworm prevention. The local shelter had him listed as 10-12 years old, but our veterinarian said he is actually about 6-8 years old. He is great with the foster\u2019s other 3 dogs, has been cat tested, and is wonderful with the foster\u2019s grandkids\u2026 His only downfall is that he barks at the neighbors cattle\u2026.endlessly!

        "description": "Meet POLLY !\n\nPolly is a gorgeous Labrador Retriever mix that was found wandering out in the country in West Texas with many porcupine quills lodged in her muzzle and embedded in her gums on the right side of her face. She was found by a kind person and brought into a high kill shelter that does not provide veterinary care. A shelter partner, Levelland Animal Friends, was notified and Polly was taken to the local veterinarian. According to the veterinarian, the quills had been there for several days and because of that she could not eat and visibly had lost several pounds. The quills were removed and she healed quickly and got back to normal weight over the course of a couple of weeks.\n\nShe is around 1 to 1 1/2 years old and weighs about 65 pounds. She is doing well on a leash and is a quick learner. She knows sit and shake\u2026and really enjoys treats! She has a sweet personality and loves to give hugs (she is amazingly gentle with her hugs even though she is a tall girl)!\n\nShe has a beautiful mocha colored coat and cute white socks on all four paws. If you look really closely, you can see a hint of brindle color on her head. \n\nShe is good with other dogs. She's been around the foster\u2019s cats, but she plays a little too rough for them. It would be best for her to not be in a home with cats.\n\nPolly's adoption fee is $500 which includes her spay, current vaccinations (rabies, 2 parvo/distemper boosters, and bordatella), negative heartworm test, negative fecal, health certificate, registered microchip, and transport costs.\n\nShe is available through Levelland Animal Friends, a partner rescue of Project Freedom Ride. We are located in the Texas Panhandle. She is located with our rescue here in Texas. She would be transported on one of the PFR transports to either Meridian ID, SLC, UT, Seattle, WA, Mt Vernon, WA, Kennewick, WA, Portland, OR, Buffalo/Syracuse/Newburgh/Castleton on Hudson, NY, Philadelphia, PA, Pittsburgh, PA, Cleveland, OH, Columbus, OH, Springfield, IL, Chicago, IL, Des Moines, IA, Indianapolis, IN, Baltimore, MD, Lansing, MI, Grand Rapids, MI, Kansas City, MO, Minneapolis, MN, Stevens Point, WI, Madison, WI, Springfield/Richmond, VA, or Bedminster, NJ. For more information on how a Direct Adoption with Project Freedom Ride works or to meet this girl via video call, email laf79336@gmail.com.\n\nAs a Project Freedom Ride direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet would take place on video call (Facetime, FB Messenger Call, Whats App, or Google Duo). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.\n\nAdoption application can be accessed at the link below.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/241436494645160\n\nCheck out Project Freedom Ride and see what this amazing group is all about!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ProjectFreedomRide/\n\nhttp://projectfreedomride.org/\n",

She will even go as far as rolling over in the middle of the parking lot if that means she will get a belly scratch. Melania would make a great buddy to binge watch some Netflix and she is such a good leash walker. Melania also did well meeting a male dog at the shelter.\n\n If you have any questions regarding Melania, or if you would like to meet her, please email us at: bandrbunkhouse@gmail.com. Melania will be spayed before adoption. ",

He is a great companion who wants to be involved with whatever you are doing- sleeping in and snuggling, hiking, or watching TV. He loves belly rubs and rope or rubbery chew toys. He loves knocking around a toy to make kibble fall out. His favorite time is bedtime when he can snuggle in bed with his person. He is smart, sensitive, and would love a family to play with. Other dogs make him anxious- he politely avoids them and would like to be your only dog. He has so much love in his heart that it sometimes shows up as an affectionate hand nibble. He can pull sometimes on the leash but is easily redirected. He is quiet and is good being in a crate. If you\u2019re interested in meeting Chip, please send an email to bandrbunkhouse@gmail.com. Chip will be neutered before adoption. \n",

He loves playing fetch, lived with a small dog and he is strong on the leash but walks very well if you use a harness.

He's ready for adventures, cuddles, and all the belly rubs you can offer.  He is low to medium energy and very treat motivated.\n\nOther Dogs: For the most comfortable environment, he thrives with female canine friends or enjoys quiet time alone with his owner.  \n\nMack was found as a stray in a small, rural West Texas town.  He was discovered in a backyard and was beat up by another male dog landing him at the vet clinic a few days.  Thankfully he is all healed and ready for his second chance!  If you're looking for a loving, goofy companion who will keep you on your toes (and laughing!), then Mack is your guy!\n\nTo ensure a happy and successful placement, we're seeking a loving home with someone who understands the unique personality of a Bull Terrier!\n\nContact us to about this amazing dog and see if he's the perfect fit for your forever home! \n\nFamilies with cats: Local Texas adoptions only so we can cat test in your home environment.\n\n***********************************************************************\nTO BE CONSIDERED, PLEASE COMPLETE AN APPLICATION!\nhttps://form.jotform.com/220199338769066\n\nLocal adoption fee: $225\n\nIf adopting outside of Texas:\nPROJECT FREEDOM RIDE ADOPTION FEE:\n$500 (includes transport)\n\nMack is currently located with our rescue in the Texas Panhandle.

        "description": "Neiko, a regal Akita with a soul full of sunshine, has been waiting for his forever family for a over five years. While the circumstances of his owner surrender remain a mystery, Neiko's spirit remains unbowed. This playful senior is a walking contradiction: wise and experienced yet bursting with youthful energy. He adores car rides with the windows down, the wind ruffling his fur, and wouldn't dream of missing out on a scoop of dog-friendly ice cream (it's practically a tradition!). A champ on walks, Neiko would happily explore new trails with you by his side. While Neiko isn't a fan of other furry friends, his focus is squarely on his human companion and bonds quickly.  If you're looking for a loyal, loving dog who thrives on adventures (and maybe shares your love for frozen treats!), Neiko could be your perfect match. Don't let his extended wait deter you - Neiko's heart, though patient, is brimming with love waiting to be unleashed. \n\nNeiko is a favorite among volunteers and enjoys outings with them. He is such a great dog with big love and big personality. He deserves a home of his own!\n\nNeiko came to Saving Grace in November 2018. He was found wandering the streets and his owner didn't want him back when Lubbock Animal Services contacted them. He has a gorgeous brindle coat that makes him look so handsome and unique! He is the biggest, sweetest fluff ball you will ever meet!  Neiko holds his toys in his mouth and dances around on his back legs when he's happy - which is all the time. \n\nFamilies with cats: Local Texas adoptions only so we can cat test in your home environment.\n\n************************************************************************************************\n\nTO BE CONSIDERED, PLEASE COMPLETE AN APPLICATION!\nhttps://form.jotform.com/220199338769066\n\nLocal adoption fee: $225\n\nIf adopting outside of Texas:\nPROJECT FREEDOM RIDE ADOPTION FEE:\n$600 (includes transport)\n\n************************************************************************************************\nNeiko is currently located with our rescue in the Texas Panhandle.

        "description": "Meet Ella: The Three-Legged Wonder Dog (Looking for a Forever Adventure Buddy!)\n\nHowdy there! My name's Ella, and let me tell you, I'm a firecracker of a pup!  Life started out a little ruff \u2013 me and my best bud, Ava, were found all alone at an abandoned house. We then landed at a shelter, but let's just say country livin' wasn't quite the life for energetic pups like us. Especially since space was tight, and you know, the whole \"risk of euthanasia\" thing wasn't ideal. Thankfully, we were then moved over to Saving Grace until a home comes along.\n\nBut hey, that's all in the past! Now I'm on the hunt for my forever home, and let me tell you, it's gotta be full of fun and adventure.  I may be missing a leg (don't worry, it doesn't slow me down one bit!), but my spirit is bigger than life! I may be three-legged, but I have the energy of four!  Walks in the park or just cuddling on the couch - I am down for all!\n\nWhile I adore my pal Ava (who also needs a home), we also enjoy time apart.  I am happy to shower a new family with all the love I've got.  \n\nSo, if you're looking for a vibrant, fun-loving pup who's ready to conquer every walk and cuddle session with enthusiasm, then look no further!  Don't be discouraged by my missing leg \u2013 my heart and spirit are full, and I'm ready to fill your life with endless joy.  Please contact Saving Grace and tell them you want to meet Ella, the three-legged wonder dog, and let's start our forever adventure together!\n\n********************************************************************************************************\n\nWatch these videos of Ella playing (copy and paste into your browser):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/g_BA-p4VrS8\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rIf50FjgiRs\n\nPlease consider adopting a special needs pet.

        "description": "Meet Sonny! This handsome 7 month old is settling into his foster home. Once he warms up, he prefers to be with other dogs and enjoys hanging out on the couch with the person he feels most comfortable with. \n\nHe is all puppy, enjoys chewing and collecting items from around the house. He is working on house training, crate training and basic obedience. \n\nHe is good with cats and does well on a leash. \n\nHe has yet to be around small children. He startles easily so he may be better with older children that won't startle him so much. (He is not reactive but runs off in the house until he realizes he is okay, sometimes going to his crate 'safe place')\n\nFenced yard preferred. \n\n\nAvailable for adoption through Humane CNY. Applications on the website. Email info@humanecny.org for more information.Contact HumaneCNY if interested in this animal. You can fill out application to adopt at the shelter.",

He's a connoisseur of durable toys like Goughnut, Kong Extreme and Benebones that can keep him plenty busy while you are busy.

Kenzo is no exception, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he was on the brink of death by starvation when he was rescued by a traveling nurse, an awesome Good Samaritan, in literally the nick of time. Through heroic efforts, he was saved from a devastating fate. It took a village and a lengthy recovery period to bring him to his current condition: healthy, bright-eyed, beautiful, playful -- dare we say even rambunctious?;) -- and full of life. What Kenzo could use now is a home of his own with loving adults who will provide plenty of play and exercise; structure, routine & gentle guidance; some basic training; a safe environment; and most importantly, a lot of love and affection for this sweet, affectionate boy. He loves to run and is nonreactive when walking/running on leash. He is a big strong boy but not a puller. Treats are motivating to him so the ABC's of training should be a fun bonding experience for him and his new person/people. He loves food, toys, lucky mats, and puzzle games. He is also house trained. Are you ready to be Kenzo's final rescuer and give this brave survivor his forever oasis? You can apply for him online by filling out an application on our website, www.humanecny.org; or email info@humanecny.org; or call us at (315) 457-8762.Contact HumaneCNY if interested in this animal.

        "description": "Weight: Approx. 45 lbs.\n\nIdeal Home: Active family with respectful kids; other dogs may be okay pending meet & greet; cats possible.\n\nFavorite Thing: Outings and adventures.\n\nHandsome Hunter is a perfectly medium-sized dog and appears to be a mix of cattle dog and some Shiba Inu thrown in for good measure. He's very friendly and interacts sweetly with staff and volunteers. No guarding, no aggression. He is not particularly interested in play time and is at his happiest on walks, runs, car rides, and adventures. We are hoping his new family will be an active one who will include him in their busy lives and activities such as riding around to their kids' various sporting events, hiking, walking, trips to the family camp, etc. Hunter will love all of it. Of note, Hunter was inadvertently exposed to a pair of cats [by a member of the public] in a recent incident at Humane. Although the situation was unfortunate -- but no worries, all involved are safe & sound -- Hunter was nonreactive to the kitties. Because of this situation, we think cats may be okay for him. Are you ready to adopt Hunter into your happy, active home? Then please fill out an application on our website, www.humanecny.org; email info@humanecny.org; or call us at (315) 457-8762 to set up your meet and greet with Hunter.Contact HumaneCNY if interested in this animal.

Looks wise she is unique, a real beauty. But we all know looks aren't everything, and Diamond does not disappoint when it comes to what she has to offer below the surface. So does Diamond have wonderful qualities that reflect her outward appearance? Yes, she she absolutely does. First of all, as her forever human companion/s, you will have endless options for activities, adventures, and bonding. That's because Diamond has a wide range of interests. She loves playing with toys, loves the kiddie pool and being in water (even likes being bathed), loves riding in the car and outings at the park, walks, and trail hiking. Speaking of walks and hikes, another area where Diamond shines is her nonreactivity to prey, such as squirrels, as well as to other dogs and people. Even in the veterinarian's lobby and waiting room, she completely ignored two tiny dogs sitting close by and all the other distractions going on around her. She was also great with the vet and staff during the exam. The volunteers who spend the most time with Diamond have been working on some of her basic training needs; and being a young dog, she would benefit from more training once she is comfortably ensconced in her new life outside the shelter. On a final note, the fact is that Diamond's most brilliant quality is her love of human companionship. While it's true that she has a long list of things she loves, for Diamond nothing is more valuable than being loved by a human and receiving physical affection from them and being close to them. We've seen here at Humane that she bonds very strongly with the people who spend the most time with her, and those people are equally head over heels about her. Do you have a nice big space in your life and your heart for a girl who will give her all to you? If you do, please contact HumaneCNY at 315-457-8762 to set up your meeting with Diamond.Contact HumaneCNY if interested in this animal. You can fill out application to adopt at the shelter.",

They found their forever homes, but their beautiful, soulful-eyed mama is still waiting for hers. Darla is a shy girl but has branched out over the months she's been with us. After her pups were all adopted, Darla was able to start going on longer walks. Initially she was pretty overwhelmed by all the new sights, smells, and sounds; but she's come a long way since those early days and instead of keeping her tail tucked between her legs, she now holds it up proudly most of the time. Now that she's more confident, her world has gotten bigger as she goes for car rides and outings to parks. She is walked by a number of HumaneCNY's volunteer walkers; however, she prefers women to men. She is playful and energetic and really loves to romp around with her HumaneCNY canine BFF Jester. We think the best fit for Darla is a low key household with a predictable routine and family members who will offer plenty of TLC and a solid foundation upon which Darla can continue building her self-confidence.

        "description": "Weight: Approx. 55 lbs.\n\nIdeal Home: Adults, older kids; low-traffic home; fenced-in yard; other dogs possible pending meet and greet.\n\nFavorite Thing: Giving sweet kisses to his human pals.\n\nToby's story is a heartbreaking one. Someone hit him in the head with a baseball bat, and when his rescuers arrived to help, he was found cowering in the basement. It's difficult for us to process the notion of such profound suffering so you can only imagine how hard it must be for Toby. What we know about Toby is that he takes some time to trust humans, and sometimes in new environments he has moments of pure panic, desperate to get back to his safe place. Can you really blame him? What we also know about Toby is that once he warms up to you, he will cover you in kisses, show off his very good manners for treats and will ask you to play with him. It's why he is a fan favorite at the shelter. When you meet Toby for the first time, he won't be the dog that runs up to you, wagging his whole body in excitement. He'll appear aloof, staying close to the people he knows or ignore you to sniff around and play with his toys. This may be one of the reasons he has been passed over by potential adopters time and time again. As Toby approaches one full year at the shelter, we are renewing our commitment to finding him his place in the world and a home with a family who will go slowly with him and allow him to build relationships at his own pace. Trust us, he will get there! He would also benefit from a fenced-in yard where he can explore the outdoors while feeling safe. As Toby moves through adolescence into adulthood, trauma has once again raised its ugly head, as it often does at this age. For Toby that means walks can be scary. He can be fine one moment and then panic, bolting for home. For this reason, he may not be a great candidate for a family who wants to bring their dog on lots of walks or hikes, at least not yet. He would love to lounge in the house with you, play with enrichment toys, go for car rides (Toby is good in the car and enjoys it), and run around in a secure yard. Are you the family for Toby? Are you ready to have a life filled with kisses and silly antics? Yes, you'll need patience, but aren't the best things in life worth waiting for?

He also recalls very well when you call his name no matter what he's doing. Marley loves playing fetch, chewing on his favorite toys and going on car rides. He seems to be very interested in playing with other dogs and has successfully met and romped around with a few dogs at the park. He is a very loving boy who needs someone that has the time and patience to continue working with him, although he is very smart and picks up things fast!

Lots of play and walks will be essential to her well-being and success fitting into the household. She's still young enough that she exhibits puppy mouthing and jumping when overexcited and will need some further work (from what she's been receiving at HumaneCNY) on her basic manners. However, she's highly food-motivated and alert so training could be a great bonding experience as well as fun for both dog and new owner/s. Currently she knows \"sit,\" \"down,\" \"touch,\" and \"place,\" all of which are great foundational commands upon which to build. On her walks, Brownie stays alert and settles in nicely. While she may be a little zig-zaggy, she's not a big puller. If you're interested in meeting young, sweet Brownie, please contact HumaneCNY by calling (315) 457-8762 to set up an appointment.Contact HumaneCNY if interested in this animal.

Because of the extreme hardships she suffered in the days before she arrived at HumaneCNY, she can be wary of strangers. However, with a little bit of effort in the form of a walk or two and plenty of treats, she soon gives herself over wholeheartedly. It needs to be noted that Mandy will require several visits over the course of a couple weeks by potential adopters so that both she (and you) can develop a nice bond before she goes home with you. The recipients of her trust receive an abundance of love, kisses, and happy dances. She has a tried-and-true fan base of staff & volunteers here at HumaneCNY because she is such a lovebug as soon as she lets you in. Mandy loves to go for car rides, outings, and walks. We think she would be happiest in a home with a friendly, playful male dog that is medium to large size. This is a girl who loves to play! If you're interested in winning Mandy over and gaining the companionship of one of the most loving and fun dogs you'll ever meet, please contact HumaneCNY at (315) 457-8762.Contact HumaneCNY if interested in this animal.

He does GREAT with other dogs in fact, accepts their different personalities and just gets along. \nHe also LOVES his walks (working on his pulling), his jaunts on the nearby beach, playtime. He is a joyful, happy go lucky, happy-to-be-loved kind of guy, who loves giving kisses and getting pets. \n\nIdeal home for Mr. Paco would be one that loves and cares for him of course, and is committed to him forever (we promised him that). A home that will give him the exercise he needs every day in terms of walks, hikes, playtime. A home with an additional canine or two would be great. Adult only home or one with older kids since he can be mouthy occasionally. \n\nPaco is utd on all shots and is neutered. He is about 2.5 yrs old and weighs 55 lbs. \n\nHave questions?

She has gotten used to other dogs over time, but she is blind so she enjoys having her personal space with other dogs, too! Prin is housetrained as well! She does have diabetes, so her adopter would need to do injections for her to keep her happy and healthy! Prin is currently resting comfortably in a foster home, but give us a call to find out more!

She is only about a year old, and is a mixed breed gal (unfortunately we don't know what she's mixed with, maybe raccoon?) Ruby is wonderful with everything! She is great with other dogs, loves to play, and has been friendly and outgoing with everyone she meets. She ignored the cats in her foster home. She would be best suited for an active family or someone who is interested in taking walks or going to the dog park. Ruby is about 50 lbs. and has an adorable nub tail. Guess what?! Ruby is housetrained, cratetrained, and great in the car! She seems to enjoy water as well! Give us a call to ask about how to take Ruby on your summer adventures! ",

She is a lightweight at 25 lbs. \nAngie was used as a breeder, having many litters in her life. She loves to carry around a squeaky toy in her mouth. She is not really into playing with other dogs, she kinda does her own thing. She is great on leash and doesn't get overheated easily like some bulldogs do. Angie is the sweetest girl; she loves to be cuddled with. She will do a couple of stairs, but does not do a whole set of stairs. \nShe is crate trained and housetrained.\nAngie has been spayed, dewormed, flea treated, and has had her rabies vaccine and distemper/parvo/leptovirus vaccine. She is also microchipped. Her adoption fee is $400.\n\nWould prefer an adopter with breed experience. \nAdopters must be a homeowner. We no longer adopt to renters :(\nAdopters must be an hour drive from Syracuse NY \nAdopters must fill out our application and be approved by Rescue.\nPlease contact us if you are interested in Angie and fit the criteria for adopting her. We will send you our application.\nThank you. \n\n\n",

He is puppy pad trained. Housetraining is a work in progress. He is a happy guy, but has some resource and food guarding issues with other dogs in the home. Jasper would flourish in a home as an only dog. \nJasper is neutered, vaccinated (rabies, kennel cough, and his distemper/parvo), dewormed, on heartworm preventative, flea treated, and is microchipped. \n\nAdopters must be a homeowner.\nAdopters must live within a 1 1/2 hour drive from Syracuse, as a home visit is required.\nAdopters must complete our application, complete with personal and Veterinary references.\nJasper is still a puppy, so a home where an adult is there with him most of the day, (for example, someone that works from home most of the work week} as he still needs training and socialization.\n\n\n",

With a little bit of time and lots of treats, I'm sure to be the perfect pup! \n\nI am currently located in Texas but am available for adoption in multiple states across the country. My out of state adoption fee is $750. This fee includes:\n     spay/neuter\n     age-appropriate vaccinations \n     a registered microchip\n     a heartworm test (if over 6 months)\n     current flea/tick prevention\n     the health certificate for travel\n     the cost of travel (drivers, gas, and vehicle maintenance)\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can meet on a video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).

Plus, I'll do literally anything for a snack. I already know some basic commands, but I am smart enough to learn whatever you want as long as there are treats involved! \n\nI've been at the SPCA of Brazoria County since before Christmas. When I came in, I had a shock collar on. It had been on so long, it had embedded in my neck and I had a total of four puncture holes where the prongs had settled in! Luckily, my friends at the SPCA are kind and worked to earn my trust, and I've turned into quite the good boy. \n\nA few people have been drawn to my beautiful eyes and coat, but I haven't found my fur-ever home yet. I'm hoping that my perfect family will come along soon!",

Nova is always smiling and happy... she loves people and playing with other dogs. She is very energetic and would benefit from having an active hooman that makes sure she gets some dedicated playtime and teach her some basic commands to help her focus and settle down. When she's excited to see you, Nova can jump several feet straight up in the air (and sometimes on her people), and she gets the crazy zoomies that make her run around like a cannon ball with her butt tucked under her. She's good with the inside foster cats once she has a chance to meet them, not sure about outside cats.

Nala was found roaming a neighborhood with a large tumor (pictured in comments).  We agreed to take her into rescue and got her into our vet quickly.  During her spay, it was determined the tumor was an adenocarcinoma (mostly likely cancerous tumor) that was attached to her vagina/anal glands.  The vet totally removed the tumor with no issues for Nala, but did tell us that it could come back.  \n\nCurrently, Nala is a healthy 3 to 4 year old Chihuahua Mix that weighs around 9 - 10 lbs.  Her adopter just needs to know her background and that she may have another tumor that comes back and would be willing to just LOVE HER and provide a wonderful home until that happens.  (Note:  She had lived several years with the tumor as large as it was with no issues).  Nala gets along with kids, dogs and cats.  She loves to sit in your lap and sleep under the covers.\n\nWe really just want this sweetheart to get all the attention she deserves in a forever home, so will be willing to waive any adoption fee to help with that.  If transported, we would ask the adopter to pay for the transport fee.\n\n\n\n\nTo apply fill out our online Adoption application at https://form.jotform.com/80635351784158\n\nOur dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Northern States.

She doesn\u2019t do well in a city environment, it stresses her out too much. \nBecause of her previous experience, Zara takes her time trusting people, it can take up to a month to gain her trust but once you have it, she is very loyal and loving. She likes other dogs her size or bigger, she can be somewhat vocal when playing and a bit rough. She loves the kiddie pool and car rides. She needs a person willing to be patient and loving. \n\nTo apply fill out our online Adoption application at https://form.jotform.com/80635351784158\n\nOur dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Northern States.  We have transports that leave Texas monthly.  Our out of state adoption fee is $600 per dog. This fee includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, a registered microchip, a negative heart worm test (if over 6 months old), health certificate, flea/tick monthly preventative and transport costs.

        "description": "Maggie was found dumped in a dirt road and saved by her first foster dad. After a month with him, it\u2019s time to find her forever home.\n\nA few key points about Maggie- Maggie loves snuggles, and she can typically be found cuddled up on someone\u2019s chest or as the little spoon. She\u2019s somewhat of a mosey along type of girl. She tends to be mellow as a default- she isn\u2019t initiating a ton of play, but will feed off of another dog\u2019s energy. Her best home is probably one with another dog that can help her learn the ropes of the house- for instance, she does best on a leash when she has another dog to follow (but she doesn\u2019t pull, so easy to walk!). She doesn\u2019t love crates, but she currently free roams a small area in her foster home with access to a doggy door. Like any 8 month old puppy, Maggie sometimes finds some mischief. The cat is quite intriguing right now, and no matter how much she barks at it, it still won\u2019t play. \n\nTo apply fill out our online Adoption application at https://form.jotform.com/80635351784158\n\nOur dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Northern States.

Freyja was dumped on a dark road in the middle of nowhere and was almost hit by a car. She had obviously recently had puppies that were no where to be found.  A kind lady took her  in but she can't keep her.  \nShe is so amazing the stuffed animals and stuffed beds explode with excitement in her presence!   She is a very affectionate dog that would love to snuggle on the couch.  She really need a loving family that can be home with her and take her on car rides because she love to ride, especially with the windows down.\nShe just loves her 9 yo human foster sister (her favorite person).  Sometimes she forgets she is a pretty big girl and excitedly likes to jump on people as she runs and plays. We are working on that to correct that behavior.  Due to her size caution and training recommended for her.   She will need help with housebreaking, since her fosters  work long hours and have not been able to keep her in the house and set her on potty schedule.  She is not a fan of her crate and can be vocal about it.  She is not a fan of my crate and can be vocal about it.  Like a typical pitbulI she will need some strong chew toys.  What she really needs is a family with time, patience and some experience with training to see the potential she has to be a wonderful companion.  She is great off lead. \n\n\nOur dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Northern States.  We have transports that leave Texas monthly.

        "description": "Rowan is a sweet, happy goofball that doesn't know his own strength. He was found abandoned on the side of a rural road with three other dogs. Rowan is always smiling and happy... he loves people and playing with other dogs. He is very energetic and will greet you with enthusiastic high jumps that almost knock you over. Rowan is good with the inside foster cats once he has a chance to meet them, not sure about outside cats. He is good with other dogs, even around food, but sometimes he's so oblivious that he gets in situations where he gets attacked, but he doesn't fight back. Rowan is house broken and crate-trained, and he's waiting for his new life. \n\nTo apply fill out our online Adoption application at https://form.jotform.com/80635351784158\n\nOur dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Northern States.  We have transports that leave Texas monthly.  Our out of state adoption fee is $600 per dog. This fee includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, a registered microchip, a negative heart worm test, health certificate, flea/tick monthly preventative and transport costs. The adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Face time, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.

        "description": "Meet Mia !! She is the biggest ball of love !! Mia loves the water, playing with other doggies & humans. she\u2019s great with kids and all dogs. Mia was born into foster and as she grew we noticed her two back legs are what the vet calls \u201ccow hocked\u201d, that means her hocks are set inwards resulting in a splayed appearance in her back legs. but that doesn\u2019t slow her down one bit!! she\u2019s had no issues with it and we hope this doesn\u2019t effect her from being adopted, she\u2019s just as amazing if not more! \n\nTo apply fill out our online Adoption application at https://form.jotform.com/80635351784158\n\nOur dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Northern States.  We have transports that leave Texas monthly.  Our out of state adoption fee is $575 per dog. This fee includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, a registered microchip, a negative heart worm test, health certificate, flea/tick monthly preventative and transport costs. The adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Face time, etc). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.

He has shown resource guarding behaviors at times. This is not a dog for a 1st time dog owner. He needs a routine and a confident handler. He is handsome, smart and loyal but he does need the right fit. ",

He was transported to a home in Colorado where he has attached strongly to the family he currently resides with there.\n\nBolt has a comical personality and loves to toss his toys around and to gallop around the backyard. His other favorite past time is snuggling with his people. Bolt has become inseparable with the young human child in the house and he and Bolt spend most of their days joined at the hip. \n\nBolt is extremely soulful and devoted to whomever he attaches to as his family. He loves his people so much that it leads him to feel overly protective of them with outside visitors. Bolt's current home is devastated that they are unable to be his forever family, due to their home being high traffic with many visitors.  It takes Bolt a long time to accept new visitors into the home and for him to understand that new people are not a threat to him or his family.\n\nBolt enjoys being the only dog in the house and is not a fan of sharing his people with other dogs. We are seeking a home for Bolt in which unfamiliar visitors are rare, as this would allow him to feel safest.  His undying loyalty to his owner(s) would make him the most devoted companion to a lucky family of his own. \n\nRoams to Homes Rescue will arrange transportation for Bolt to an approved adopter anywhere in the United States.

        "description": "Amora was dumped on the streets of NYC and brought to the New York Animal Care Centers by police on April 27th.\n\nShe was terrified and not doing well at the shelter. \n\nHer time was coming to an end and she needed a savior.  A wonderful woman decided to step up for her and therefore saving her life.\n\nShe is now ready for her forever home.\n\n\nAmora's STATS                 \n\nApproximate age: 1 year        \nApproximate weight: 68 lbs              \nBreed (s): American Staffordshire Terrier mix    \nSpayed or neutered?: yes\nGood with:       \n\nkids? Unknown, but likely older kids 13+ \nstrangers?  Needs slow introductions with new people. She can warm up to them with treats and several meetings.     \nother dogs?  Yes, she loves playing with other dogs, both small and large \ncats? Yes, either ignores cats or sniffs and walks away    \nOn leash? Yes, she does well on leash with minimal pulling on walks\nHousetrained? Yes, she is perfectly house trained. She has not had a single accident in her foster home.           \nCrate trained?  Yes, she is good in crate up to 8 hrs at her foster home. She may whine a little at first, but will settle down especially with a bone. She did better in the crate when we placed it near our other dogs crate. \n\n\n Amora\u2019s perfect home would be with adults or older children (13+) who will initially take the time to earn her trust because believe me, it is so worth it! She is a sweetheart who just wants to be loved, but just needs a little extra time and effort in the beginning for her to warm up to a new family. A relatively calm household with not many visitors may be best for this reason. She does well with other dogs and ideally, her perfect home would have other dogs since they help her confidence and she loves to play with them. She is also happy to be relaxing on the couch and will gladly lay down and take a nap. She is good mix of a dog who is active while also knowing how to be a couch potato. Since she mostly ignores cats, they\u2019re okay too!\n\nAmora LOVES rolling in the grass.  Likes to play fetch, may or may not bring the ball back\nVery snuggly with her people. She is a shadow who follows you around the house and always want to be with you. \nKnows sit and we are working on down and touch\nThinks she is a lap dog despite her size\n\nAmora can be shy/timid with new people. She needs someone who will go slow with her and understands it can take several visits with a new person for her to warm up to them. Once you win her trust though, it\u2019s worth it!  \n\nFearful of new situations outside her home. Her foster home is currently working to build her confidence in these situations and she will need someone who will either be content staying at home with her or can continue to work with her outside the home. \n\nAmora is a 1 year old female who came to us from NYC ACC where she was at risk of euthanasia due to being fearful in the overcrowded shelter. Her shelter notes say \u201cThis poor, sweet girl.  This girl was brought to the shelter as a stray, but one would think beautiful AMORA was dumped by here family and was all alone in the streets not knowing who to turn to or where.  She is trembling in her kennel and so incredibly scared.  She is not aggressive.  When someone comes to visit her and take her out, she continues to tremble with her little tail tucked.  But when this new friend opens her door and kneels down, saying softly \u201cwant to go for a walk outside sweet girl?\u201d she finds in herself the courage to slowly move forward and walks quickly with them to the play yard.  She is soft and gentle, quiet and good.  She doesn\u2019t want to be a bother. She wants so much to be loved and comforted.  She just needs that quiet, calm, loving space where she can decompress and then warm at here own pace to a new life and a new family who will never, ever abandon her again.  We know she is holding her heart close, but we also know that Amora would be all love and cuddles, loyalty and devotion to the family that chooses her to be their friend.\u201d  In the short time she\u2019s been in her foster home so far, time and patience have already made a world of a difference from her description in the shelter. She has already started to come out of her shell to show her playful, loving personality. While she does take time to warm up to people, she has a lot of love to give to the right family. She is a dog who will initially be an investment of time and effort to gain her trust, but in the end, it will pay off for her forever family because she truly is an amazing dog. \n",

She looks very much like a very petite shepherd or kelpie mix and weighs only 40ish lbs. This litter of puppies is also on the petite side, and we believe that they will most likely take after their mother and be similar to her medium stature. Every puppy from this litter that was lucky enough to score a foster home thus far has received raving complements from their fosters. Their fosters report to us that they are extremely smart puppies, with great dispositions. All in foster homes have picked up potty training quickly for their young age and are very much people pleasers. We know that Phelps will shine once in a home and that there is a family out there who will feel incredibly lucky for him to complete them.\n\n**Note - R2H enforces a strict spay/neuter policy.

        "description": "IS YOUR HOME SADIE'S PERFECT FUREVER HOME? Sadie is a beautiful 5 year old purebred 40 lb. liver/white female Brittany. She is spayed, heartworm negative, up to date on vaccines and on heartworm and flea and tick preventatives. This sweet girl is also housetrained and crate trained. Sadie is highly active and loves to explore outside. Her foster mom has never witnessed her digging or trying to escape and Sadie has excellent recall. Sadie would love to have a big yard where she could run and explore. With proper training and supervision, Sadie's foster mom thinks Sadie would be a candidate for an invisible fence. In true Brittany fashion, Sadie is both intelligent and eager to please. Sadie does pull when walked on a leash and even though her foster mom and dad are working with her, she will need continued and consistent training. Although Sadie will tolerate other dogs, she is not extremely fond of their company. Sadie would love a home where she has no fursiblings. She has lived in a home where she was the only dog and that is what she is accustomed to. If you are looking for a beautiful smart middle-aged Brittany lady and you want an only dog, then Sadie could definitely be your gal! Her adoption fee is only $350 (to help cover vetting and to allow NBRAN to help rescue other furbabies like Sadie). Don't forget that NBRAN will transport adopted dogs up to 1400 miles, with the adopter only being responsible for the last approximate 100 miles. To learn more about Sadie, contact Suzanne Horsley ztasuzanne@gmail.com or Deb Tuthill agilitybrits@epbfi.com",

OJ is still a very young guy and his mannerisms are quite puppy-like. OJ didn't have the best start to things. When he first arrived he was in pretty poor shape. Since being at SHHS he has really blossomed. He has been learning how to play with toys and his overall confidence has drastically improved. He has also gained quite a bit of weight and is finally at a healthy size. OJ's desire to please is so strong it can be overwhelming at times. He wants so badly to bond with his handler that sometimes his excitement gets the better of him. What he is really looking for is security and stability in both his person and environment. OJ is housetrained and knows basic commands. He even walks quite well on a leash. \n\nOJ does not do well with other dogs, but may be fine with cats. \n\nTo summarize OJ:\n\n*Excitement level = Giant Puppy\n*Must be an only animal\n* Must be fed in a safe space\n*11/10 Snuggler\n\nDid we mention he's super duper handsome and the goodest boy?!\n\nIf you feel OJ may be a good fit for your family, contact SHHS today to come and meet him!",

I would love to find a home where I can gain confidence and learn to experience life in a positive way. I enjoy the company of other dogs as long as they are larger than me. I am very particular about who I share a home with and must have a feline-free home. If you are a patient person who would love to add a playful, fun and spunky young pup to your life then I'm your gal!",
