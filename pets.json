Bubbles will tear plush toys apart within minutes.\n\nBubbles is currently being treated for skin issues with medicated baths. Bubbles will be scheduled for mammary mass removal and spay surgery. Simple surgery that the rescue pays for.\n\nBubbles is a compact snuggle bug who loves attention. Her history is unknown, as she was found tied to a tree in a park in NYC. Bubbles then found herself on the euthanasia list, and became my foster. She will “smile” and wiggle when she is happy. Bubbles loves a warm bath and a peanut butter filled kong. Bubbles loves to wander around her fenced in yard, however, she does well on a leash as well. \n\nBubbles knows the command “sit”, and is currently working on “down”, “shake”, and heeling. Bubbles loves all snackies including Dunkin munchkins. Bubbles loves to ride in the car. Bubbles does well in a crate, however, she may tear blankets up. \n\nWhile Bubbles has never had an issue with any people she has met, Bubbles does not appear to be a fan of other dogs.\n",

  "description": "3 year old Lobo is SO beautiful (pictures truly don"t do him justice) and weighs about 60-70 pounds. He is well-behaved, very affectionate, and loves attention! He rarely barks and is house & crate trained, displaying good behavior both indoors and outdoors. He stops 2 feet from his crate and will sit and wait for his person to pet, kiss, hug him, and then he goes in his crate while he waits for his goodie! Such a sweetheart and loves his people! He sleeps peacefully in his crate at night and travels well in the car. Lobo does well with other dogs of different sizes and is very friendly with people! \n\nWith a moderate activity level, Lobo enjoys walks of varying lengths. A fenced yard or active lifestyle is ideal for Lobo and he is not trained to be off-leash. Lobo responds to basic commands like sit, stay, come, heel (for leash walking), and off (for not jumping on people). Lobo is ready for a loving home to cherish and support him throughout his life. Could you give him a lifetime of love?\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***LOBO IS IN NORTH TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE. Read below for more information.\n\nOur dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. The adoption contract and fee are finalized prior to transport. As a Pep"s Pals Rescue direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc). \n\nOur adoption fee is $275 plus health certificate and transport (varies by location). This adoption fee includes all current vaccinations, deworming, microchip (additional $12.99 registration fee required at time of adoption), fecal analysis, spay/neuter, and a heartworm test if over 6 months old. All dogs are current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention. A health exam will be completed and a health certificate issued by a veterinarian within 10 days of transport.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the adoption application below:\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/57837/generic",

Lindy is an absolute love bug who is currently in the process of house and crate training. She will bark to let you know when she needs to go out and is not destructive inside or outside. While she does bark because she’s a puppy, it’s not excessive and she can be easily redirected.\n\nLindy sleeps in her crate with her brother at night and is dog-friendly. We think she could be cat-friendly and would likely do well with kids, although she can be a bit jumpy, as puppies often are.

Lindy is learning the commands “sit” and “stay,” and she loves treats, toys of all kinds, playing with her brother, and snuggles.\n\nLindy’s ideal home would be with an active family that has a fenced yard and someone to play with her.

  "description": "Meet Rowdy, an adorable 4-month-old male puppy looking for his forever home! With his beautiful, unique ears and loving personality, how could anyone pass this sweet boy up? \n\nRowdy is in the process of house and crate training and already barks to let you know when he needs to go out. He"s not destructive inside or outside, and while he does bark because he’s a puppy, it"s not excessive and he can be easily redirected.\n\nRowdy sleeps in his crate with his sister Lindy at night and is dog-friendly. We think he could be cat-friendly and would likely do well with kids, although he can be a bit jumpy, as puppies often are. Rowdy loves to run and play, but he also enjoys being held and snuggled. \n\nWe"re currently working on his leash training, and we believe he’d make a great running or hiking partner as he gets older. Although he"s only been in the car once, he did great. Rowdy is learning the commands “sit” and “stay,” and he loves treats, toys of all kinds, playing with his sister, and snuggles.\n\nRowdy"s ideal home would have a fenced yard and someone to play with. He likes to have someone around a lot and enjoys cuddling, hanging out on the furniture, and showing his affectionate side. Rowdy is ready to become a cherished member of a loving family.\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***ROWDY IS FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE. Read below for more information.\n\nOur dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue. The adoption contract and fee are finalized prior to transport. As a Pep"s Pals Rescue direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).\n\nOur adoption fee is $500 plus health certificate and transport (varies by location). This fee includes all current vaccinations, deworming, microchip (additional $12.99 registration fee required at time of adoption), fecal analysis, spay/neuter for dogs 6 months & older (if under 6 months, $100 of adoption fee is returned to adopter when proof of mandatory neuter is provided to us at 6 months of age), and a heartworm test if over 6 months old. All dogs are current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention. A health exam will be completed and a health certificate issued by a veterinarian within 10 days of transport.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the adoption application below:\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/57837/generic",

  "description": "Meet Zeke, a 3-year-old, 60 pound bundle of affection who will capture your heart. His joy comes from being close to his human, displaying both exuberant and cuddly moments. Zeke is house and crate trained, responsive to commands like sit & down, and a quick learner eager for treats. While well-behaved, he tends to jump when overly excited and requires ongoing guidance for manners. His favorite place is the couch with his head in your lap, all he wants is to be near his humans!\xa0\n\nZeke gets along with other dogs and people, and we are unsure of how he does with cats. While likely good with kids, a home with kids over 10 is advised due to his size, as he enjoys running and jumping, potentially knocking over small children.\xa0He loves eating from his big Kong slow feeder bowl. We have worked on his manners and he is going great, but needs reminders.\xa0He is\xa0very smart, loves his kennel,\xa0toys, and treats.\xa0He is not food aggressive with his food toward humans or other dogs.\n\nThis playful pup loves chew toys. Harvey sleeps in his kennel at night and when home alone to prevent mischief. Enthusiastic about car rides, he remains curious and adventurous. He even enjoys days at doggy daycare! Rescued from a high-kill shelter in East Texas after his owner died & he was living on a chain 24/7, Zeke has transformed into a confident, happy, and sweet companion. An active household with another dog for him to play with, ideally a fenced yard, and perhaps someone to accompany him on runs, walks, and hikes would be amazing for Zeke. Apartment living would not suit his energetic nature. Zeke is ready for his furever home!\xa0\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***MOST OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE.

All dogs are current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention (he did test heartworm positive, but is almost done with his slow kill treatment for heartworms covered by the rescue & doesn’t require activity restriction - not contagious either & he will need to be retested in June).

Presley is in search of a warm and caring forever home where she can relish in moments of play, affectionate cuddles with her human or furry siblings, and rest easy without the fear of ever being let go, a fate she once experienced with her previous family.\n\nPresley is a devotee of quality time with her human companions, and she adores her walks, exhibiting excellent behavior on the leash with people and not pulling much. She is house and crate trained, and knows the commands "sit," "stay," and "come."\n\nIn her foster home, she is cat friendly and displays a friendly attitude towards other dogs, even plays with the other dogs\xa0in the yard!\xa0She is not good with chickens, but she is good with tortoises lol! She is dominant, so her ideal future home would be with submissive dogs, as she thrives in an environment where she can take on the alpha role without conflict. Slow, proper introductions to other dogs and cats are crucial! She does constantly yearn to be by her human\"s side, but she has grown to truly enjoy being a part of the pack in her foster home and would do so in her forever home as well. While on a leash, Presley exhibits reactivity towards other dogs and animals; however, she responds well to redirection and can be easily guided.\n\nWe rescued Presley from a high-risk shelter in Texas just in the nick of time. She was on the brink of being euthanized due to space constraints, especially being the shelter\"s longest-standing resident. Her previous owners were contacted, but they showed no interest in reclaiming her or her Husky friend.\n\nPresley\"s tale is one of resilience and unwavering loyalty. She longs for her forever family, a loving home where she can be cherished unconditionally. Is there anyone out there willing to provide Presley with the love and care she so rightfully deserves?\n\nDISCLAIMER- Breed type is determined based on general appearance and behavioral characteristics and cannot be guaranteed unless DNA test results or AKC registration were provided at intake.\n\n***PRESLEY IS FOSTERED IN TEXAS, BUT AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AND TRANSPORT OUT OF STATE.
